<h2>PREFACE.</h2>


<p class="noi"><i>Dear Boys</i>:</p>

<p>Here is a brand-new line of stories for you, to
be issued under the general title of “The Motor
Boys Series.”</p>

<p>The motor-cycle of to-day is fast taking the
place of the ordinary bicycle, and the automobile,
or auto, as it is commonly called, is taking the
place of our horses. This being so, it has occurred
to the writer to prepare a line of stories, telling of
the doings of a number of lively, up-to-date lads
who at first own motor-cycles and later on become
the proud possessors of a touring car.</p>

<p>This tale before you, “The Motor Boys,” is the
first volume of the series, telling of the doings of
Ned, Bob, Jerry and their chums in and around
their home town. Some stirring races are mentioned,
and also the wicked plots of some enemies
to bring our heroes to grief. At the races some
fine prizes were put up, and Ned, Bob and Jerry
did their best to carry off the honors. In the meantime
there was a mysterious robbery of a mill, and
what the lads did to solve this riddle I leave to the
chapters, which follow, to relate.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_vi" id="Page_vi">[vi]</a></span></p>

<p>This story of “The Motor Boys” will be followed
by a second volume, to be called “The
Motor Boys Overland,” and then by a third, “The
Motor Boys in Mexico.” I hope these volumes
will please my boy readers.</p>

<h1>THE MOTOR BOYS.</h1>




<h2><a name="CHAPTER_I" id="CHAPTER_I">CHAPTER I.</a><br />
<small>AN ENCOUNTER ON BICYCLES.</small></h2>


<p>“Hi, Ned! what do you say to a little race?”</p>

<p>“I’m ready,” called Ned Slade.</p>

<p>“How about you, Jerry?”</p>

<p>“Oh, I’m always ready,” answered Jerry Hopkins,
tossing aside the core of an apple he had
been eating. “But how far is the race to be,
Chunky?”</p>

<p>“To the oak tree,” replied Bob Baker.</p>

<p>“Suits me,” said Jerry. “All aboard!”</p>

<p>The three bicyclists rose from the grass where
they had been resting in the shade of a big maple
tree, after a trip of about five miles on their bicycles
around the country outside of the village of
Cresville, where they lived. Cresville was a pleasant
town, not a great many miles from Boston.</p>

<p>The three boys were chums, and had been ever
since they had started to school together, eight
years previous. There was Bob, the son of Andrew<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[2]</a></span>
Baker, who was counted one of the wealthiest
men in Cresville. His interests were varied, but
were mainly in banks and banking institutions.
Besides Bob there was in the family a daughter
Susie. Bob was fourteen years old, and Susie
two years younger, and Bob was so much inclined
to stoutness that he was sometimes called “Chunky”
by his chums.</p>

<p>Ned was the only child of Aaron Slade, owner
of the largest department store in the town, and
a well-off merchant. As for Jerry he lived with
his widowed mother, and his sister Julia Hopkins,
a girl whom it would do your heart good to know,
she was so jolly and full of fun. The death of
Mr. Hopkins, a few years previous, had left his
widow with an ample income, which she devoted
to the bringing up of her children. Jerry and
Ned were the same age, fifteen years.</p>

<p>All three boys were sturdy chaps, full of life
and energy. They had studied, played and fought
together so long that they had come to be regarded
as three inseparables by the townspeople.</p>

<p>“Now are you fellows ready for the word?”
asked Bob, steadying his wheel in a line with the
other two.</p>

<p>“Let her go!” called Jerry.</p>

<p>“Sing out, Chunky!” shouted Ned.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[3]</a></span></p>

<p>There was a moment of suspense, and a momentary
thrill over even so slight a thing as this little
sprint among the three boys. Each one meant to
win.</p>

<p>“Go!” yelled Bob.</p>

<p>In an instant the wheels were started off. Three
boys bounded into three saddles. Three pairs of
feet began to pump the pedals desperately. A
cloud of dust arose and the race was on.</p>

<p>It was a distance of half a mile from the maple
tree, where the start was made, to the oak which
Bob had designated as the winning post. The
road was a good hard level stretch of macadam and
the wheels fairly spun along it.</p>

<p>At first the boys were on even terms. Then
Bob gradually drew away from Ned and Jerry.
Seeing this Ned put an extra ounce or two into his
pushing and he soon caught up to Bob. These two
held the lead on almost a line for a few hundred
feet.</p>

<p>Suddenly there was a whirr of wheels behind
them, an excited joyous shout and, with a yell,
Jerry whizzed past, and obtained such a good advantage
that he kept it, until he reached the oak,
where he leaped off, and cast himself down in the
shade to rest.</p>

<p>“I didn’t think you could do it, Jerry,” panted<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[4]</a></span>
Ned, as he and Bob flashed up two seconds later.
“Honest, I didn’t.”</p>

<p>“Nor I,” came from Bob. “You must have
been practicing lately.”</p>

<p>“Well, I thought I ought to try and improve
my wheel-work,” said Jerry modestly. “I’m
thinking of going in the club races that will be
held soon, and I wanted to stand some sort of a
show.”</p>

<p>“I’d say you stood a pretty good one, if you
ride like you did to-day,” interposed Ned. “You
went past us flying, and Bob and I weren’t going
so slow, either; were we, Bob?”</p>

<p>“Not exactly.”</p>

<p>For a few minutes the boys lolled lazily in the
grass, enjoying the fresh air and sunshine. Then
Bob took three apples from his pocket and treated.</p>

<p>“Do you fellows know what I wish?” began
Jerry, who had finished his light lunch first. “I
wish we all had motor-cycles.”</p>

<p>“It wouldn’t be a half-bad idea,” agreed Bob,
after a little thought. “I’m beginning to get a
little tired of this leg-work, myself. How about
you, Ned?”</p>

<p>“I think I could use a motor-cycle if one came
my way,” replied Ned. “That is after I learned
how to operate one, and wouldn’t blow myself<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[5]</a></span>
and the immediate neighborhood up with gasolene.”</p>

<p>“They’re easy to run,” affirmed Jerry, “and no
more dangerous than a horse. The catalogue I
have says so.”</p>

<p>“That reminds me, are you two going in the
bicycle races?” asked Jerry. “You know there
are going to be some fine prizes.”</p>

<p>“You mean the Cresville Athletic Club races?”
asked Ned.</p>

<p>“Yes,” replied Jerry.</p>

<p>“I hadn’t thought much of it,” said Bob. “I
heard about ’em, but it takes a lot of time to train,
and you have to almost starve yourself.”</p>

<p>“How about you, Ned?”</p>

<p>“Well, if you and Bob go in for it, Jerry, I
s’pose I might as well too. Tell us what you
know about the races.”</p>

<p>Jerry related what he had heard about the plans
of the athletic club to hold an out-door meet on
their grounds three weeks hence. As he had said,
several valuable prizes were to be awarded, and
there were many classes of handicap contests, so
that the boys would have plenty of chances to enter,
and stand a good show of winning one or more
of the trophies.</p>

<p>“It sounds good,” said Ned at length.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[6]</a></span></p>

<p>“I’m going to enter, and begin training at
once,” decided Chunky.</p>

<p>“Same here, then,” came from Ned. “Have
you entered yet, Jerry?”</p>

<p>“No, but I’ve begun to train some. There’s
plenty of time to send in your name if you want
to enter. The lists are open until five days before
the races.”</p>

<p>“All right, then it’s settled,” exclaimed Ned,
slowly rising from his comfortable berth in the
grass.</p>

<p>The three boys mounted their wheels and started
slowly homeward. They took their time, keeping
close together and talking now of the coming
races and again of the prospects of owning motor-cycles.
At the top of a long, gentle sloping hill,
that led down, almost to the centre of the town,
the boys put their feet on the coasters and let
their wheels glide down by gravity. Soon they
were going at a rapid rate, with Ned slightly in
the lead.</p>

<p>At the foot of the hill another road crossed at
right angles. By reason of a turn to this second
road, and a clump of trees, any one passing along
it could not be seen until he was nearly in the
middle of the hill road.</p>

<p>Suddenly there shot from behind the clump of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[7]</a></span>
trees lining the cross-road, a figure on a wheel.</p>

<p>“Look out!” yelled Bob and Jerry.</p>

<p>Ned looked up and saw, but was too late. He
could not check his speed, and the only thing to
do was to turn to one side, and try to avoid the
other rider. Unfortunately the other rider, also
seeing the danger, took the same turn as had
Ned.</p>

<p>“There’s going to be a smash!” called Jerry in
excited tones.</p>

<p>The shock threw Ned and the other cyclist from
their wheels into the dusty road. The bicycles
went in one direction and the riders in another.
Both boys were lying still on the highway when
Bob and Jerry came running up.</p>

<p>“Are they killed?” asked Jerry in a trembling
voice.</p>

<p>“No, only stunned, I guess,” answered Bob,
feeling of Ned’s heart, and finding it beating.
“Let’s see who the other fellow is.”</p>

<p>He turned the boy who had collided with Ned
over.</p>

<p>“Noddy Nixon!” he said. “He’ll be sure to
say this was Ned’s fault, and it may make trouble.
I wish Ned had put on his brake.”</p>

<p>Ned sat up and opened his eyes. A few seconds
later Noddy Nixon did likewise.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[8]</a></span></p>

<p>“What happened?” gasped Ned, rubbing the
dust from his eyes.</p>

<p>“You had a little spill, that’s all,” answered
Bob.</p>

<p>“A little spill? I should say we did,” snarled
Noddy, who was larger and stronger than any of
the three chums, and older, being about eighteen.
“A nasty little spill it was, too. And all your
fault, Ned Slade! Why didn’t you look where
you were going?”</p>

<p>“Why didn’t you look?” asked Ned, hotly.
“I turned out to avoid you, and if you’d been paying
attention you wouldn’t have steered right into
me. It’s as much your fault as it is mine.”</p>

<p>“My leg’s broke,” came from Noddy. “You’ll
suffer for this!”</p>

<p>“Get up and let’s see if it’s broken,” urged Bob,
taking hold of Noddy’s shoulder.</p>

<p>“Oh! Ouch!” screamed Noddy, who though
he was strong and a bully was also a great coward
in pain. “My shoulder’s broken, too. I’ll sue
you for this, Ned Slade, after I get well, and I’ll
lick you, too.”</p>

<p>“Oh, dry up!” muttered Ned, who was painfully
limping toward his wheel.</p>

<p>When Noddy came to move he discovered that
he was not as badly hurt as he had foolishly imagined.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[9]</a></span>
He got on his feet, brushed the dirt from
his clothes, and found that he could walk all right.
But he scowled darkly when he saw Bob grinning
at him.</p>

<p>“You’re more scared than hurt,” said Bob.</p>

<p>“Look here, you impudent little snob!” burst
out Noddy, limping over toward the boy who was
still smiling. “Don’t give me any of your lip. I
won’t stand it. I’ll knock your head off!”</p>

<p>“Better not try,” advised Bob quietly, the smile
leaving his face. “Two can play at that game.”</p>

<p>“Yes, and so can we all of us!” broke in Jerry,
who was something of a boxer. “We’re sorry
for what happened, Nixon,” he went on, “but you
needn’t rub it in.”</p>

<p>“Oh, shut-up!” cried Noddy, turning away,
and picking up his wheel. “I’ll get even with
you for this, though,” he muttered.</p>

<p>“Two of my spokes are broken,” he went on,
after an examination of his bicycle. “You’ll have
to pay for them, Ned Slade.”</p>

<p>“So are two of mine, and my handle bars are
bent,” retorted Ned. “I guess we’ll call it even,
Noddy. I won’t charge you for straightening the
handles,” and he laughed in spite of the pain of
his bruises.</p>

<p>“You&mdash;you!” began Noddy, but rage seemed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span>
to choke him, and with scowling face he mounted
his wheel and rode slowly away. “You just
wait!” he shouted back, shaking his head at the
three boys.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_II" id="CHAPTER_II">CHAPTER II.</a><br />
<small>A MEAN PLOT.</small></h2>


<p>“Well,” began Bob, when the three chums
were ready to proceed on their way, Ned having
been brushed off, “I’d like to have Noddy for a
close friend, I don’t think! Wonder what makes
him so mean?”</p>

<p>“Born so, I s’pose,” grunted Ned. “Any one
else would have laughed over such an accident.
He seemed to think I did it on purpose.”</p>

<p>“He talks as though he did,” ventured Jerry.
“I wonder what he’ll do to get square?”</p>

<p>“Oh something sneaking, you may depend on
it,” replied Bob. “That’s the way with Noddy
and his kind. He’s nothing but a big bully.
Never fights with any one but some one he’s sure
he can whip. I don’t know’s I could lick him,
but I’d like to try once.”</p>

<p>“Me too,” said Ned, “after I get over being
stiff.”</p>

<p>When Jack Pender, who was a toady of Noddy
Nixon, called on the latter in a sort of club-house<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span>
in Nixon’s yard that night, he found the bully in
no amiable frame of mind.</p>

<p>“What’s the matter?” asked Jack.</p>

<p>“None of your business,” snapped Nixon, lighting
a cigarette.</p>

<p>“You needn’t be so cross,” whined Jack, who
was used to rather shabby treatment from the
bully, to whom he toadied in the hope of favors.</p>

<p>“I guess you’d be cross if you had the tumble
I did to-day,” growled Noddy.</p>

<p>“Somebody knock you down?” asked Pender,
incautiously.</p>

<p>“Somebody knock me down? I’d like to see
’em try it,” boasted Noddy. “No. I was out taking
a spin, and that young cub of a Ned Slade tried
to upset me. I got even with him, though,” added
Noddy, to whom telling the truth did not come
natural. “I gave his wheel a twist and sent him
flying. I guess he won’t forget his fall in a hurry.
He got worse than I did,” which was not so,
though Jack did not know it.</p>

<p>“Serves him good and right,” chuckled the
toady. “I can’t bear Ned. He’s too uppish.
Thinks because his father has a little money he’s
better than the rest of us. And I haven’t any use
for his chums, Bob and Jerry.”</p>

<p>“Same here,” agreed Noddy, lighting another<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span>
cigarette. “But I’ll get even with ’em. My
father has as much money as any of their fathers’
has. They needn’t think they can down me.”</p>

<p>“Bully for you,” cried Jack, hoping to curry
favor. “I’d like a chance to get even too.”</p>

<p>“Maybe it will come before you think it will.”</p>

<p>“What do you mean?” asked Jack in a whisper.</p>

<p>“Never mind,” replied Noddy. “I’ll tell you
when the time comes.”</p>

<p>For some time the two cronies sat and talked
in the structure, which Noddy had fixed up as a resort
where he might smoke cigarettes, a practice
his father had forbidden him.</p>

<p>“Going in the club races?” asked Jack at
length. “I hear there will be some fine prizes,
and a little chance to make money.”</p>

<p>“You mean on the winners?”</p>

<p>“Sure. I got the tips straight from one of the
trainers. There’ll be a pretty penny in it for us.”</p>

<p>“It’s worth looking into,” decided Noddy.
“But about my racing. I hadn’t thought of that.
I suppose I could go in.”</p>

<p>After some further talk both Jack and Noddy
decided they would enter their names for several
events in the bicycle class. When they parted that
night they agreed to meet the next evening to discuss
details.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span></p>

<p>Not long after dusk the following night Jack
and Noddy were in close consultation in “the
coop.”</p>

<p>“I hear Ned, Bob and Jerry are going to enter
the races,” said Jack, after a short conversation.</p>

<p>“Why, you’re not afraid of them, are you?”
asked Jack.</p>

<p>“I know I can beat either Ned, Bob or Jerry.
The only thing is I’m not in good training and
I can’t spare the time. I’m faster than either of
them for a short sprint,” which he was. “But
in a long race they might down me.”</p>

<p>Jack did not think it wise to comment on the
bully’s change of ideas.</p>

<p>“If the races were hundred-yard dashes I
wouldn’t worry a bit,” said Noddy. “I could
win hands down. But the best race is for three
miles, and that&mdash;that’s rather a long distance for
me. If we could fix things&mdash;”</p>

<p>“How fix?” inquired Jack.</p>

<p>“Well,” proceeded Noddy boldly, “I mean to
win that race. There’s a first prize, worth three
hundred dollars, and I want it. I’m going to get
it. That’s all. If I can’t win by fair means&mdash;”</p>

<p>“I see,” whispered Jack softly.</p>

<p>“I’m glad you do,” retorted Noddy, lighting a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span>
cigarette. “I may need your help. We must
beat them, Jack. I hate them!”</p>

<p>Thereupon the two cronies resumed their whisperings,
talking in low tones, for they were fearful
of being overheard in their plotting.</p>

<p>Within the next few days arrangements for the
races of the athletic club went rapidly on. Bob,
Ned and Jerry entered their names, Ned finding
that he had no permanent lameness from his
“spill.” Noddy and Jack also had their names
entered. Then all the boys, including many others
who had decided to try for the prizes, began training.</p>

<p>There were several events on the race card.
There were ten and five mile races, but none of the
boys thought of trying for them. There were also
short distance trys for girls, and also a three mile
race, for boys and young men between fourteen
and nineteen years of age. The first prize was a
three hundred dollar piano, or any other article of
that value, and the second and third prizes were
of one hundred and fifty and one hundred dollars
value respectively. Of course each of our heroes
hoped to win big prizes, and there was a keen but
friendly rivalry among them.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_III" id="CHAPTER_III">CHAPTER III.</a><br />
<small>THE DAY OF THE RACES.</small></h2>


<p>At last came the day for the races. It was early
in July, and the weather though warm, was not oppressive.
Early in the morning a big crowd started
out toward the grounds of the Cresville Athletic
Club, which were about a mile outside of the
town proper.</p>

<p>Ned, Bob and Jerry reached the track about ten
o’clock, and found it pretty well occupied.</p>

<p>“It will give us good practice in wheeling in a
crowd,” observed Jerry as he stripped off his sweater
and, in regular racing costume, began to make
the circuits.</p>

<p>His two friends soon followed his example. A
little later Noddy and Jack arrived. The two
cronies kept to themselves and spoke no word to
our three heroes.</p>

<p>About noon-time there was a general stopping
and all the contestants who were warming up went
to get something to eat. Under Jerry’s advice
Ned and Bob ate and drank sparingly.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span></p>

<p>The races were to begin at two o’clock. Long
before that hour most of the best seats were
filled, and there was a crowd on the way to the
athletic grounds that would tax the capacity of the
bleachers.</p>

<p>About half-past one o’clock a rather gaunt individual
might have been seen making his way toward
the athletic grounds. He wore a pair of
patched trousers and a green coat, with a red patch
on either elbow.</p>

<p>“Hi there!” called some boys. “Look at the
hobo going to enter the races.”</p>

<p>“Oh, I may be a hobo, but I’m not a dodo; put
that in your pipe and smoke it till night. That
ain’t a good rhyme, but it’ll do this time,” recited
the man in a sing-song tone.</p>

<p>“Ha! Ha! Isn’t he funny!” laughed some
small boys.</p>

<p>Hearing the sound of laughter Ned, Bob and
Jerry, who were walking together in the fields, a
short distance away from the athletic grounds,
came over.</p>

<p>“Why it’s Old Pete!” cried Bob. “Hello
Pete! I say, Old Pete Bumps!” he called,
waving his hand to the man with a green coat and
a red patch on either elbow.</p>

<p>“Oh, I say, is that you, why how do you do?”<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span>
said Mr., otherwise Old Pete Bumps, who was a
general man of all work about Mr. Baker’s place.
He did everything from feeding the chickens to
taking out the ashes.</p>

<p>“Hello Pete!” called Jerry and Ned in chorus.
“What did you come for? Are you going to
race?”</p>

<p>“Am I going to race? Well not in this place,”
replied Pete gravely. “I came to watch over you
boys. Be a sort of general overseer as it were.
Look after the wheels and see that they get full
meals,” he added without a smile.</p>

<p>From which it may be inferred that Mr. Bumps
was something of a character.</p>

<p>Indeed at one time he had been a well educated
man. But an injury to his head, caused by a fall,
and a number of misfortunes, had displaced him
from a life of comparative wealth, and had made
him a sort of foolish, though very loving, elderly
man. Mr. Baker had taken pity on him and made
a place for him, for which poor Old Pete Bumps,
as he called himself, was very grateful. He was
very fond of children, especially boys, and was always
looking after the interests of Bob and his
chums.</p>

<p>“Now Pete can look after our wheels,” said
Bob. “I was wondering who we could leave in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span>
charge between the heats, and while we were
dressing. He’ll be the very one.”</p>

<p>“Surely will I, e’en though I die,” said Pete
gravely, for he had a habit of making extemporaneous
rhymes on all occasions, which jingles sometimes
fitted and sometimes did not.</p>

<p>“All right, Pete,” said Bob. “Come on over
here,” and he led the hired man to where the boys
had left their three wheels in charge of a lad of
their acquaintance, who had agreed to stand guard
at the rate of five cents a half hour. Pete gravely
squatted down on the grass near the bicycles.</p>

<p>Relieved of the responsibility of guarding their
mounts, the trio of lads wandered about the
grounds of the club. There was much bustle and
excitement. New riders were constantly arriving
and going out on the track to warm up. Hundreds
of spectators were coming afoot, or in carriages
or automobiles. Flags waved gaily in the
wind, and the whole scene was a spirited one. A
bevy of girls coming up the road that led to the entrance
of the grounds attracted the attention of
our three heroes.</p>

<p>“Looks like my sister Susie with that red dress
on,” said Bob.</p>

<p>“And that seems to be Julia, in that green hat,”
observed Jerry. “Yes, that’s her,” he went on.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span>
“I can tell by her laugh,” he added, as a merry
peal floated over the green field.</p>

<p>“Who are the girls with them?” asked Ned,
who had no sisters, but who was as fond of girls as
they were of him.</p>

<p>“There’s Mollie Horton, who lives near me,”
said Ned. “She’s jolly enough. And Alice
Vines. I don’t know who the other one is.”</p>

<p>“That’s Helen Gale,” put in Bob. “I know
her. She made that silk flag with our foot-ball
colors on last year for me.”</p>

<p>“Good for her!” exclaimed Ned.</p>

<p>The girls soon came up, and there was merry
talk for a little while. The boys wanted to take
the girls over and buy some ice-cream sodas.</p>

<p>“We haven’t time,” objected Julia. “We
want to get our seats before the races begin. We
don’t want to miss a one.”</p>

<p>“You won’t miss anything,” assured Ned.</p>

<p>“Oh but we might,” interposed Alice. “And
it is not every day we can come to such a big event
as this. If you boys want to get the sodas afterward&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Of course we will,” broke in Jerry. And so
they agreed to treat the girls after the races.</p>

<p>Not long after Pete had been left in charge of
the cycles a man, wearing a slouch hat, who had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span>
been but a few minutes before in close consultation
with Jack Pender, shuffled up to where Pete was
lying in the grass.</p>

<p>“Arternoon, mate,” said the roughly dressed
man in a growling voice.</p>

<p>“How do you do, I’m glad to see you,” replied
Pete, in his sweetest tones.</p>

<p>“What yer givin’ us?” demanded the stranger.</p>

<p>“Me? I gave you nothing, sir,” replied Pete.</p>

<p>“Come off your high perch then, an’ talk United
States,” went on the stranger gruffly. “My
name’s Bill Berry, what’s yours?”</p>

<p>“My name’s Pete Bumps, I’m full of humps,”
recited Pete gravely.</p>

<p>“You look it,” commented Bill Berry. “But I
say, mate,” he went on, “how would you like to
go off and get a good smoke? Come, I’ll pay for
it?”</p>

<p>“I’d like it first rate, but I must stay here quite
late,” said Pete.</p>

<p>“Why so? Oh, I don’t know,” mocked Bill,
falling into the eccentric mood of his companion.</p>

<p>“To guard the wheels against the steals,” replied
Pete.</p>

<p>“Don’t let that worry you,” went on Bill, eagerly.
“I’ll stay here. You go get yourself something<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span>
to smoke, and take your time. I’ll stand
guard while you’re away.”</p>

<p>If there was one thing more than another that
Old Pete liked, it was to smoke. Usually he had
to forego this pleasure because of lack of funds.
Now here was a chance to indulge. So, after receiving
twenty-five cents from Bill Berry, Pete
started over to the grand stand, near which was a
booth where cigars and refreshments were sold.</p>

<p>Bill looked narrowly about as soon as Pete was
out of sight. There were plenty of people around
him, but no one seemed to be noticing what he was
doing. Quickly Bill pulled a wrench from his
pocket and used it on each of the three bicycles.
Then he brought out a stick of something black.</p>

<p>“This graphite is well doctored,” he muttered.
“I guess it won’t be healthy for the chains.”</p>

<p>He rubbed a liberal supply on the chain of each
wheel, and also on the sprockets. Then he rapidly
opened the tool bags on each machine, took out the
graphite he found there, and substituted some of
his own.</p>

<p>“I guess that will do the trick,” he said softly.
“And I guess I’ve earned my two dollars, Jack
Pender.”</p>

<p>He hurried off, mingled with the crowd, and a
little later was in conversation with Jack Pender.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span></p>

<p>A little later Pete came hurrying back. He was
smoking a cheap cigar, and his pockets bulged with
others.</p>

<p>“Here you go, Bill, now smoke with a will,” began
Pete, when he drew near where he had left
his new friend in charge of the boys’ bicycles.
“Why, he’s gone,” he went on, seeing the deserted
mounts. “Wonder where he went?” However,
he did not give much thought to it, and went on
smoking happily.</p>

<p>“Wheels all right?” asked Ned a few minutes
after, as he, Jerry and Bob came up.</p>

<p>“Right as a fiddle, come high-diddle,” recited
Pete.</p>

<p>“Hark! What’s that?” asked Chunky suddenly.
“Sounds like an announcement.”</p>

<p>The three boys ran nearer the grand stand where
the official announcer stood. The man was using
a small megaphone and went on to say that there
had been a slight change in the program, and that
the race for those who had never been in a contest
before would be the first number instead of the
third.</p>

<p>“Great Scott, Chunky! That’ll mean you’ll
have to hustle for all you’re worth!” cried Jerry.
“Here, get your wheel out, strip off your sweater<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span>
and get around to the track entrance and have
your number pinned on.”</p>

<p>Jerry grabbed up his chum’s wheel, while Ned
assisted the lad in pulling his sweater over his head.
Then, cautioning Pete to keep a strict look-out, the
three boys ran with Bob to the track entrance.</p>

<p>They were only just in time, and found a lot of
other contestants ahead of them. Bob received
his number, and then, for the first time, thought of
his wheel.</p>

<p>“Just spin it for me, to see if it don’t need a
drop more of oil,” Bob asked Jerry. “My hands
shake so I can’t undo the tool bag.”</p>

<p>Obligingly Jerry spun the wheels. The rubber-tired
circle went around swiftly for several turns,
and then came a sudden slowing down.</p>

<p>“That’s funny,” remarked Bob. “I had that
all adjusted this noon.”</p>

<p>Jerry bent down and looked at the bearings.</p>

<p>“The cones have been tightened,” he announced.
“Why I can feel the friction,” and he moved the
front wheel slowly with his hands.</p>

<p>“Try the back wheel!” urged Ned.</p>

<p>Holding that clear of the ground Jerry spun it
by placing his foot on the pedal. There was a
woeful squeak, and, after a few revolutions that
wheel, too, slowed down. Jerry rubbed his finger<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span>
over the sprocket chain. It came away black from
the graphite, but mingled with the blackness were
many shining specks.</p>

<p>Just then there came the crack of a revolver.</p>

<p>“That means three minutes to the start,” cried
Bob. “What will I do? I can’t fix the wheel
in that time!”</p>

<p>“Some one’s put iron filings in the graphite,” announced
Jerry, rubbing the stuff between his fingers.
“There’s trickery here!”</p>

<p>“And I’ll lose the race!” cried Bob. “I know
I have a good chance of winning!”</p>

<p>“Let me get my wheel!” exclaimed Ned.</p>

<p>“It wouldn’t do any good,” interposed Jerry.
“We haven’t time to run after them. Besides, the
chances are our wheels are doctored too.”</p>

<p>“All ready, boys!” warned the starter.
“Minute and a half more before the final gun!”</p>

<p>“I might as well quit,” cried Bob.</p>

<p>“Don’t you do it!” said some one suddenly at
his side. “Here, you take my wheel. It’s a
racer, and I’ve just oiled it.”</p>

<p>As he spoke a boy, of about thirteen years, who
had a slight acquaintance with our three heroes,
shoved a handsome new wheel over toward Bob.</p>

<p>“Oh, thank you, Sam Morton,” said Bob.
“But don’t you want it yourself?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span></p>

<p>“Not a bit,” said Sam. “I’m not going to
race. Take the wheel.”</p>

<p>“All right, I will,” assented Bob. “And I’ll
square things with you afterward, Sam. Some one
has doctored mine. I&mdash;”</p>

<p>But Bob did not have time to say any more.</p>

<p>“Half a minute!” warned the starter.</p>

<p>“Get on the track!” cried Jerry.</p>

<p>“Line up! Do your best and win!” counseled
Ned.</p>

<p>“I will!” shouted back Bob, and the next instant
he was lined up with the others, waiting for
the pistol shot that would start them off.</p>

<p>“Crack!”</p>

<p>A little puff of smoke, a sliver of flame, and a
slight report. Then the whirr of rubber tires on
the track sounded like the wind rushing through
the trees.</p>

<p>The race, while it was of much interest to the
contestants and their friends, was not very important
to the general public. It was only a mile
sprint and there were ten starters.</p>

<p>Bob’s heart beat wildly at first and his wheel
wobbled from side to side. Then the fever of
fear left him. He saw that he was not being left
behind and he picked up courage. He shut his
teeth tightly, took a long breath, and let out a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span>
burst of speed that carried him to within three of
the leader.</p>

<p>There was a cheer at this, which gave him new
courage, and he struggled harder and harder.
Gradually he passed two of those ahead of him.
There now remained but one lad between himself
and the lead. He gave one quick glance.</p>

<p>“It’s Jack Pender,” he thought. “I know he’s
been in races before. But I’m going to beat him.”</p>

<p>Once more Bob clenched his teeth and let out
another burst of speed. But he had a good rider
to contend against. Jack, looking behind and seeing
the boy he hated, redoubled his efforts.</p>

<p>The race was half done. Already several who
had no chance had dropped out. The struggle
was between Bob and Jack. Bob could hear the
band playing, as if it was a mile away. He drew
one long breath, threw into his leg muscles another
ounce of strength and then, with an effort that surprised
even himself he found that he was on even
terms with Jack.</p>

<p>“Confound you! What are you trying to do,
beat me?” snapped Jack.</p>

<p>“That’s what I am.”</p>

<p>“Well, you’re not going to!”</p>

<p>Jack gave his wheel a sudden turn. His intention<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span>
was to upset Bob. But the latter was too
quick for him.</p>

<p>“Foul! Foul!” cried several who had seen
the attempt.</p>

<p>The two passed the post set an eighth of a mile
from the finish, neck and neck. Bob could see that
Jack was almost winded. As for Bob, though in
distress he still had some reserve strength.</p>

<p>Then, with a last final burst of speed, with a
frenzied effort that sent the blood singing to his
head, Bob passed his rival, and came under the tape
a winner by two good lengths.</p>

<p>“Hurrah!” cried thousands.</p>

<p>“Hurrah!” cried Ned and Jerry, though Bob
could not hear them.</p>

<p>And Bob, almost tumbling from his wheel, felt
happier than he ever had in his life before. He
had won the race.</p>

<p>He could see Jack Pender scowling at him, but
he did not mind that.</p>

<p>“I didn’t know you were an amateur, Jack,”
Bob heard one of the toady’s friends address him.</p>

<p>“I’m not any more,” laughed Jack. “That
was my last amateur race. I’m going in with the
professionals on the next race, and I’m going to
win.”</p>

<p>“You are if we let you,” was the response.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_IV" id="CHAPTER_IV">CHAPTER IV.</a><br />
<small>THE THREE MILE RACE.</small></h2>


<p>As soon as Ned and Jerry had congratulated
Bob, which they did with glad hearts, they hurried
from where they had watched him winning the
race, to the place where Old Pete had been left in
charge of the wheels.</p>

<p>“The chances are we’ll find them doctored,”
said Jerry. “Only we’ll have an opportunity to
fix them before our race, if they aren’t too badly
tampered with.”</p>

<p>Bob returned the wheel he had won on to its
owner, Sam Morton, and offered to share the prize
with him, but Sam would not hear of it.</p>

<p>“I was only too glad to help you out,” he said.
“You ought to make a complaint to the officers of
the club about your wheel.”</p>

<p>“Wait until I find out who monkeyed with it,”
said Bob, “and I’ll take care of him without any
complaint,” and he doubled up his fist suggestively.</p>

<p>The three chums, Bob carrying his own disabled<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span>
wheel, hurried to where Pete was. They found
that worthy consuming his third cheap cigar, evidently
in great enjoyment.</p>

<p>Jerry and Ned made a hasty examination of their
bicycles, and quickly discovered something wrong
with each.</p>

<p>“The same scoundrel that tampered with Bob’s
was at ours,” said Ned. “Bearings tightened and
steel filings in the graphite. Who was it, I wonder?”</p>

<p>“Say, Pete,” began Bob, “did any one touch
our wheels while we were away?”</p>

<p>“Not a one, my dear son,” recited Pete with a
wise air.</p>

<p>“Here Pete, you drop that poetry and attend
to business,” said Bob, somewhat sternly. “Were
you here every minute since we left?”</p>

<p>“I went over to get some cigars.”</p>

<p>“And who stayed with the wheels while you
were away?”</p>

<p>“Friend of mine. Bill Berry, fat as a cherry,”
replied Pete, unable to resist the temptation to
make a rhyme.</p>

<p>“Look here&mdash;,” started in Bob, fiercely, “I’ll
have to&mdash;”</p>

<p>“That explains it,” broke in Jerry.</p>

<p>“Explains what?” asked Bob.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span></p>

<p>“Explains who had a hand in this,” went on
Jerry. “You know Bill, who isn’t any too good a
character about town, and Jack Pender have been
quite thick of late. Two or three times I’ve caught
them whispering together down to the post office.”</p>

<p>“Well, what of it?”</p>

<p>“This much. You know what a sneak Jack is,
always toadying around that bully Nixon. Well,
Nixon threatened to get even with all of us on account
of that little spill he and Ned had. This is
how he’s done it. He’s got Jack to do his dirty
work, and Jack has hired Bill to doctor our
wheels.</p>

<p>“While we were away Bill comes over here,
bribes poor old Pete with the offer of something to
smoke to leave him in charge for a little while, and
does the trick. Didn’t Bill give you something to
smoke?” demanded Jerry.</p>

<p>“He give me the money, now ain’t that funny,”
sang Pete, without a thought of the consequences
of his act.</p>

<p>“That’s just it,” agreed Ned and Bob, and they
complimented Jerry on his shrewdness.</p>

<p>“Oh, that was easy enough to figure out,” said
the lad. “The question is, can we get our wheels
in shape for the race? We’ve got about half an
hour.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span></p>

<p>The boys lost no more time in idle regrets. Tool
bags were opened, and with wrenches and screw
drivers the three set to work adjusting the bearings
properly. Though this was a somewhat delicate
task they succeeded in about ten minutes.</p>

<p>“Now to clean the chains,” said Bob. “That
graphite must all come off.”</p>

<p>“Kerosene oil is the best,” suggested Jerry.
“Hurrah!” he shouted. “This will do!” and he
set off on the run.</p>

<p>In a few seconds he reached a lantern that was
fastened on a pole, and used, at night, to illuminate
the driveway to the club-house. “This is just
what we needed,” he said. “We’ll borrow a little
kerosene from the lamp.”</p>

<p>The tin reservoir held more than was needed,
and in another minute each boy was busy cleaning
his chain.</p>

<p>“Now to put some fresh graphite on, and we’ll
be in good shape,” cried Ned, in high glee over
the successful outcome of the plan.</p>

<p>Jerry was the first to take his stick of lubricant
from his tool bag. As he did so he gave a start.
Then he rubbed some of the black material between
his thumb and finger.</p>

<p>“I thought so!” he exclaimed.</p>

<p>“Doctored?” inquired Ned and Jerry nodded.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span></p>

<p>“Iron or steel filings,” he said. “Lucky there
is plenty of graphite to be had, or we’d be stuck.”</p>

<p>It did not take long to borrow from other cyclists
some of the stuff, and the chains were soon lubricated.
The boys still had five minutes before their
race would be called. They spent the time in resting
from their hustling labors. They had fixed
things just in time.</p>

<p>In the meantime Noddy had been rather busy
about the track. He prided himself on being a
sport and was seeking some one who would lay
wagers with him. He made several on various
events, profiting by what Jack Pender said were
sure tips.</p>

<p>“I wonder if we can’t bet something on this
race we’re in?” asked Noddy of his toady.</p>

<p>“I don’t see why not,” assented Jack. “I think
you have a good chance of winning, with those
three young cubs out.”</p>

<p>So Noddy busied himself, putting up what was
a large sum even for a youth whose father kept
him liberally supplied with pocket money. As a
matter of fact Noddy went so deep into the betting
that he had to lay considerable of the money on
“wind.” That is he did not have in his pocket
the money he would have to pay if he lost. But
then he did not think of losing.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span></p>

<p>His last wager, laid just before the time of
the three mile race, was with Paul Banner.
“Polly,” the boys called him, for young Banner
aspired to be what, a few years ago, was called a
dude. He was fond of dressing in the height of
fashion, and liked to be thought a sport. He had
a small income, did not work, and spent most of
his time at the athletic club.</p>

<p>“I’ll give you odds of two to one against the
favorite in this race,” said Noddy to Paul.</p>

<p>“And who’s the favorite?” asked Paul.</p>

<p>“Jerry Hopkins,” replied Noddy. “Come,
what do you say? Two to one he doesn’t win.”</p>

<p>“You’re on. For how much?”</p>

<p>“I’ll lay you one hundred dollars to fifty dollars,”
said Noddy.</p>

<p>“Done,” assented Paul, and he made a memorandum
of the wager.</p>

<p>At last, after several events had been run off,
during which our heroes had been busy undoing
the mischief worked to their wheels, the time came
for the race that meant so much to them. The announcer
gave the word. Ned, Bob and Jerry
hastened around to the track entrance. Noddy
and Jack, with their wheels, were a few seconds
behind them.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span></p>

<p>“Well, they’re on hand, I see,” whispered
Noddy.</p>

<p>“Yes, they’ll start, and that will be about all,”
replied Jack, with a meaning smile.</p>

<p>For a few minutes there was considerable work
getting the dozen riders correctly placed. Finally
they were all lined up on the white mark, and the
starter raised his revolver.</p>

<p>“Bang!”</p>

<p>Off in the air lazily floated a little puff of smoke.
Then the cyclists were off like the wind. My!
how they did go!</p>

<p>Noddy Nixon, who, to give him the credit he
deserved, was not a bad sprinter, was in the lead.
He was pedaling at top speed, for he knew only
by acquiring a big lead could he hope to win.</p>

<p>There was an excited shout from the spectators
as they saw the start of the race, and realized that
the favorite was left in the lurch. But if Jerry
was disconcerted, or if either Ned or Bob was, not
one of them showed it. After a few seconds
Noddy glanced back. He was surprised to see
Jerry rather closer to him than he hoped to find
him.</p>

<p>“I thought you said the wheels would lag behind,”
said Noddy to Jack, who was riding furiously
beside him.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span></p>

<p>“They must have discovered the trick and fixed
things up,” panted Jack.</p>

<p>But there was no time to talk. It was to be a
race to the finish.</p>

<p>“I’ll fix them, though,” muttered Jack, letting
up on his speed, which had kept him beside Noddy,
and dropping back a little to the rear.</p>

<p>Aside from the three chums, and Noddy and
Jack, there was no interest in the race, for the other
seven contestants were hopelessly in the rear. Bob
and Ned were on even terms, with Jerry somewhat
ahead of them.</p>

<p>“Go on, Jerry!” called Ned. “Beat the
big bully!”</p>

<p>“Don’t either of you fellows drop out!” pleaded
Jerry. “Try to win. You’ve as good a
chance as I.”</p>

<p>And then Jerry gave his attention to the task
before him. It was no light one. However, he,
as did the other two boys, felt the bicycles to be
in good order in spite of the attempts at foul play.
They were all riding well.</p>

<p>Noddy’s advantage in age, his better muscular
development, gave him a big lead, however, and
for the first mile the gap between him and Jerry
was scarcely shortened. Jack still hung on to his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a></span>
comrade’s rear, ready to play another dastardly
trick when opportunity offered.</p>

<p>During the second mile it was plain to all that
Noddy was petering out. His head bent lower
over the handle bars, and foam, like white cotton,
could be seen on his lips.</p>

<p>“I’m almost all in!” he gasped to Jack.</p>

<p>“Keep up a little longer!” entreated Jack.
“You’ll win! Why, you’ve got to win!”</p>

<p>And, to save himself in more ways than one,
Noddy felt he must succeed. But how to do it
was the question. His heart was beating like a
trip-hammer, and his head felt as if it would burst.</p>

<p>He tried to develop another burst of speed, but,
as he had said, he was “all in.” Slowly he felt,
rather than saw, Jerry creeping up on him. He
knew that Jack was between him and his rival,
however, and he hoped something might happen.</p>

<p>The crowd on the bleachers and on the grand
stand nearly went wild as they looked at the most
exciting race so far that day. The favorite was
slowly but surely creeping up on the leader, and
crowding him.</p>

<p>“Go on Jerry!” cried hundreds who wanted to
see the plucky lad win. “Go on! Go on!”</p>

<p>“Peg away, Noddy!” shouted one or two of
the bully’s friends, who had, thanks to his tips or<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span>
those of Jack, put their money up on him. “Keep
going!”</p>

<p>But it was no use. The gap between Jerry and
Noddy lessened. Ned and Bob were close behind
Jerry, and stood excellent chances of being at least
third and fourth. But there was Jack to be reckoned
with as well as Noddy, and Jerry knew this.
He felt he must keep clear of Jack, for he had seen
the attempted foul when Bob was racing.</p>

<p>Then, with a wildly beating heart, Jerry decided
that the time had come to make his final sprint.
He had just started on the last half mile. He
grasped the handle bars with a firmer grip, shut
his teeth hard and took a long breath. The burst
of speed he then let out amazed and delighted the
audience. There were wild cheers.</p>

<p>Noddy looked back in despair. He saw that
Jerry and Jack were on even terms. Then something
happened. The something that Jack had
promised to have up his sleeve. With a quick motion
he sent his wheel, ever so little over toward
Jerry. The act was hardly noticeable on the stand.</p>

<p>“Keep off!” cried Jerry, seeing what Jack had
in mind. “Do you want to have an upset?”</p>

<p>“You never mind me!” snarled Jack. “I’ll do
as I please!”</p>

<p>Again he gave his wheel a twist. He was now<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span>
riding dangerously close to Jerry. Noddy was
barely a length ahead. There was a quarter of a
mile to go.</p>

<p>“Keep back, do you hear!” yelled Jerry.</p>

<p>“Keep back yourself!” retorted Jack.</p>

<p>Then Jack deliberately fouled Jerry. He sent
his front wheel against that of his rival, intending
to cause an upset. But he reckoned without his
host. Bob, who had, by a sudden sprint, approached
nearer to Jerry than Ned, saw what was
up. Without an instant’s hesitation Bob sent his
wheel crashing full into Jack’s from the rear, and,
amid a roar of surprise and terror from the spectators,
the two boys went down in a heap on the
track.</p>

<p><a href="#image01">“He’s killed. They’re killed!” cried scores.</a></p>

<p>Jerry, with grim determination in his eyes, rode
on, never looking back. Noddy cast a frightened
glance over his shoulder, and, when he saw what
had happened his heart grew faint. He nearly
lost control of his wheel. The little swerve he
gave it was fatal to him.</p>

<p>Like a flash Jerry dashed in, took the pole, and
with a burst of speed, that set the excited spectators
into cheer after cheer, Jerry passed Noddy,
and won by a good five lengths.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span></p>

<p>“Jerry wins! The favorite wins!” shrieked
the assemblage.</p>

<p>Though Bob was out of the race, by his own
act of self-sacrifice in saving Jerry, Ned had managed,
by clever riding to escape the spill. He saw
his chance when Noddy looked back, and, with
a fierce effort passed the bully and came in a good
second.</p>

<p>Even the privilege of being third was denied
Noddy. He lost control of his wheel before
he could cross the finish line, and one of the stragglers
in the race, who had been merely hanging on
the tail end, sprinted up and came in third, so that,
for all their plans, Noddy and his toady came to
grief.</p>

<p>There were congratulations after congratulations
for Ned and Jerry. The boys blushed almost
like girls as they received the praises that
sounded in their ears. There was some talk of
the spill, but when it was seen that neither Jack
nor Bob was hurt there was no further alarm. At
first Jack sputtered and threatened to complain
that he was deliberately run down.</p>

<p>“Go ahead,” said Bob coolly. “I saw what
you tried to do to Jerry, and I know something
about Bill Berry.”</p>

<p>At that Jack and his bully friend sneaked off<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[41]</a></span>
without a word. They felt that it needed but
a few words on the part of the three chums to
get them into trouble, and they were glad enough
to escape as easily as they did.</p>

<p>“I appreciate what you did, Chunky,” said
Jerry. “You practically won the race for me, and
you had a good chance yourself.”</p>

<p>“I hadn’t a chance in the world with you in it,”
replied Bob. “Besides I won my race, so what
did I want with another? I just had to run him
down to save you. I’m glad I did.”</p>

<p>“I won’t forget it,” exclaimed Jerry, warmly,
as he grasped his chum’s hand heartily.</p>

<p>And then the three boys, each one of whom had
won a valuable prize that day, gathered up their
wheels and belongings and prepared to start for
home.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_V" id="CHAPTER_V">CHAPTER V.</a><br />
<small>A DEMAND FOR MONEY.</small></h2>


<p>Probably there was no more disgusted person
at the races that day than Noddy Nixon. He was
mad at himself, at Jack, and more than angry at
Bob, Ned and Jerry. He felt very bitter in his
heart toward them, though it was all his own
fault. Another matter that troubled him was
the money he had lost on bets.</p>

<p>“I’m in a deep hole,” he muttered as he left
the athletic grounds, “and how to get out I don’t
know.”</p>

<p>For few of the tips that Jack had given proved
good ones, and Noddy had lost in all about two
hundred dollars. This was more money than he
had possessed in some time, though an indulgent
father kept him well supplied.</p>

<p>“Where’s my father?” asked Noddy in surly
tones as the maid answered his ring at the handsome
house on the hill where the Nixon family
lived.</p>

<p>“In his study, Mr. Noddy,” answered the girl.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[43]</a></span></p>

<p>“Now to beard the lion in his den,” whispered
the young man to himself.</p>

<p>In answer to Noddy’s knock&mdash;rather a timid,
hesitating sort of a knock, and not in keeping
with the bully’s usual bluster&mdash;Mr. Nixon bade
his son enter.</p>

<p>“How are you, Noddy?” asked Mr. Nixon,
who was fond of the young man, in spite of his
bad manners at times.</p>

<p>“Pretty fair,” was the answer.</p>

<p>“Did you go to the races? Of course you
must have, to judge by your costume.”</p>

<p>“Yes, I went,” replied Noddy. “I rode in
one, just as a sort of practice. I didn’t try to win.
I only wanted to get in form. But say, father,”
he went on rapidly, “I need some money.”</p>

<p>“Money!” exclaimed Mr. Nixon, laying aside
the book he had been reading, and looking over
the tops of his spectacles. “Money? Why do
you know how much you have had in the last
month?”</p>

<p>“Not so much,” replied Noddy.</p>

<p>For answer Mr. Nixon rapidly turned over the
pages of a memorandum book. When he came to
a certain page he stopped and began adding up
some figures.</p>

<p>“The total, since the middle of last month,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span>
when I began keeping the account, to the present
time, which is just about four weeks of time, is
three hundred and seventy-five dollars,” said Mr.
Nixon.</p>

<p>“I had no idea it was so much,” muttered
Noddy.</p>

<p>“And now you want more?”</p>

<p>“I must have about two hundred dollars,
father.”</p>

<p>“Two hundred dollars! Great Scott, young
man! do you think money grows on trees? What
do you want with two hundred dollars? Are you
going to start in business?”</p>

<p>“I need it to pay a few debts with,” murmured
Noddy.</p>

<p>“I’m sorry,” said Mr. Nixon, closing the book,
“but I can’t let you have any more money now.”</p>

<p>“But father, I simply must have it.”</p>

<p>“You’ll not get it from me, young man. I’m
tired of handing you over money to waste on foolishness.”</p>

<p>“Well, I’m going to have that money,” retorted
Noddy, speaking in an excited tone.</p>

<p>“Look here, young man,” answered his father,
“don’t let me hear you speak to me again like
that. Remember you are not of age, and until you
are you are under my control. Remember also<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[45]</a></span>
that you are not too big to be whipped. I am inclined
to think that would be a good thing for you.”</p>

<p>“I’d like to see any one try it,” retorted Noddy
impudently.</p>

<p>“Leave the room! Leave the room, sir!” exclaimed
Mr. Nixon, rising to his feet, his face
white with anger. “I do not want to lose my
temper, and act hastily. Leave the room at once,”
and he pointed to the door.</p>

<p>Noddy, with a sullen and hateful glance at his
parent, passed through the portal. He slammed
the door behind him, giving vent to the anger that
raged within him. After the young man was
gone Mr. Nixon sank down in a chair. He was
trembling, and tears stood in his eyes.</p>

<p>“To think that my oldest son should be so
thoughtless of the respect due me,” he sighed.
“I wish he was better. Perhaps if he had had
to work as hard as I did to make my fortune he
would not be so wasteful. But I simply can not
let him spend any more money at present. It is
for his own good, but he can’t seem to see it. Ah
me! I wish he was a better son.”</p>

<p>Noddy went to his room, put on another suit
after doffing his bicycle clothes, and then ordered
one of the maids to get him something to eat.
After a hasty meal he left the house.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a></span></p>

<p>“I wonder if I couldn’t borrow some money
from Tom Judson,” mused Noddy, as he reached
the centre of the town, and proceeded along the
streets filled with people coming home from work.
“He must be at the mill office yet. I’ll try, any
how.”</p>

<p>Tom, the son of Amos Judson, who owned a
large iron mill in Cresville, was a young man whose
acquaintance Noddy had made some time before.
Ordinarily Tom was well supplied with money.</p>

<p>Noddy found Tom in the mill office. It was
about closing time.</p>

<p>“Hello, Tom!” greeted Noddy.</p>

<p>“Hello, yourself!” responded Tom, genially.</p>

<p>“Tom,” went on Noddy rapidly, seeing there
was no one within hearing, “can you lend me three
hundred dollars? I need it to pay a bill with in
a hurry, and I haven’t time to go home. The governor
would let me have it for the asking. I’ll
pay you back in a couple of days.”</p>

<p>For answer Tom slowly turned one pocket after
another inside out.</p>

<p>“Dead broke!” he laughed. “Just paid my
board bill and I can’t get any cash until Saturday
night. Sorry.”</p>

<p>“So am I,” joined in Noddy.</p>

<p>“If you want to crack the safe there,” went on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[47]</a></span>
Tom, pointing to an old-fashioned one that stood
in a corner, “you could get three hundred dollars,
and more. I saw dad put one thousand dollars in
bills in there a while ago. Some people paid their
debts late this afternoon, and he didn’t want to go
to the bank so near closing time. But I guess you
don’t want to crack a safe, do you, Noddy?”</p>

<p>“No,” replied Noddy, with an uneasy laugh, as
he left the mill office.</p>

<p>“Good night,” called Tom, as he proceeded to
put his books away. Then, seeing that the safe
was closed, and locking the office door, he went
home.</p>

<p>“Everything fails me,” muttered Noddy.
“But I simply must raise the cash&mdash;somehow. I
wonder&mdash;”</p>

<p>But he hardly dared whisper even to himself
the thought that came into his mind.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_VI" id="CHAPTER_VI">CHAPTER VI.</a><br />
<small>AT THE CLUB HOUSE.</small></h2>


<p>Following the last of the races at the athletic
grounds it was announced that the Cresville Club
would tender, that night, a reception to all participants
and their friends. There was to be a little
entertainment and refreshments would be
served. The prizes would also be awarded.</p>

<p>Bob and his sister Susie were going, Ned would
be there and Jerry Hopkins had promised to take
Julia. Besides it was expected that a number of
boys and girls, friends of the three chums, would
be present.</p>

<p>When Bob, Ned and Jerry, with the two girls,
reached the club house that evening, they found
a big crowd already there.</p>

<p>“Oh, there’s Alice Vines and Helen Gale!” exclaimed
Susie, leaving her brother and running over
to where the girls stood.</p>

<p>“Yes, and there’s Mollie Horton!” exclaimed
Julia. “I’m real glad she came,” and Julia ran
from her brother and joined Mollie.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[49]</a></span></p>

<p>“Well, it looks as if we’d have to paddle our
own canoes,” remarked Jerry, with a laugh.
“Deserted the first thing, after the glorious victories
we won, too.”</p>

<p>“Let’s pretend we don’t want to talk to them,”
suggested Ned. “That’s the surest way to bring
the girls around,” which holds true of old as well
as young girls, it may be said.</p>

<p>“Come down stairs and I’ll treat you all to ice-cream,”
invited Jerry.</p>

<p>The boys were hurrying away, not looking in
the direction of the girls, when there was a flurry
of skirts and a miniature cyclone descended about
the lads.</p>

<p>“What’s that I heard about ice-cream?” asked
Julia, with a laugh, as she ran up and grasped her
brother by the arm.</p>

<p>“Did you hear anything?” asked Jerry, in an
innocent tone.</p>

<p>“Yes, and I happen to have some sort of a
vague recollection about a promise of ice-cream
sodas made by some one this afternoon,” went on
the girl, laughing. “Do you boys recall anything
about that?”</p>

<p>“I guess the joke is on us, boys,” said Bob.
“Come along, girls, you shall have the ice-cream.”</p>

<p><a href="#image02">It was a jolly little party that gathered about </a><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[50]</a></span>
<a href="#image02">the ice-cream tables.</a> They had almost finished
one plate each, when a boy with light hair, that
never seemed to be combed, and blue eyes that
twinkled like two stars and a mouth that always
seemed to be open, either while he was talking or
laughing, came up.</p>

</div>

<p>“Hello girls! Hello fellows!” he exclaimed
rapidly, and talking by jerks. “Fine night&mdash;big
crowd&mdash;lots of people&mdash;have some more
cream?”</p>

<p>“Easy, easy,” pleaded Jerry. “You talk like
a house afire, Andy Rush.”</p>

<p>“Rush by name&mdash;Rush by nature,” spluttered
Andy. “Come, what is it? Ice-cream&mdash;candy
cake&mdash;lemonade&mdash;pick the winner!”</p>

<p>“Well, I guess the girls wouldn’t object to some
more cream,” spoke Bob. “As for me, ice-cream
sort of palls after one big plate. I’ll have some
lemonade.”</p>

<p>Andy joined the little party, and added to the
fun. He never seemed to stop talking, and he
didn’t seem to care whether any one listened.</p>

<p>“Prizes going to be given out,” cried Andy,
presently, hurrying up stairs.</p>

<p>This was a signal for a general breaking up of
the little party. As each of the three chums came
in for a prize they had to be near the platform,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[51]</a></span>
where Mr. Wakefield, the athletic instructor of
the club, gave out the trophies.</p>

<p>There was quite a jam of people in the main
room of the club, where seats had been placed to
accommodate the assemblage. The boys found it
rather difficult to get near the platform, but finally
succeeded.</p>

<p>Bob’s name was the first called. He blushed as
he went forward to receive a fine diamond scarf
pin that was the first prize in the amateur race
class.</p>

<p>After several other trophies had been given out
came the turn of Jerry to go forward and get the
first prize for the three mile race. It was announced
that the winner of this could have his
choice of any article to the value of three hundred
dollars. The money could not be given, as that
would put the winner in the professional class, Mr.
Wakefield said.</p>

<p>“We thought of giving a three hundred dollar
piano as the first trophy,” said Mr. Wakefield,
“but there is no obligation to take that, as it is
not purchased. Now, Jerry, what would you
like?”</p>

<p>“If it can be bought for that amount of money
I’ll have a motor-cycle,” replied Jerry after a moment’s
thought.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[52]</a></span></p>

<p>“That’s the stuff!” called Bob in such a loud
whisper that it was heard all over the room, and
caused considerable laughter.</p>

<p>“And a motor-cycle you shall have,” said Mr.
Wakefield, “the finest that can be bought. I am
glad you took that. It gives me a chance to say
that in the future the club intends having some
motor-cycle races. Perhaps you will compete, Jerry,
and if you do I hope you will do your best.”</p>

<p>“Three cheers for Jerry Hopkins!” called
some one, and they were given with a will.</p>

<p>“Your prize is not quite as optional as was Jerry’s,”
said Mr. Wakefield, when Ned came forward
in answer to his name. “Still we hope you will
like it. I have picked out this for you,” and he
gave the boy a magazine rifle of the most expensive
make, a regular beauty, at the sight of which
Ned’s eyes sparkled with joy.</p>

<p>“Three cheers for Ned Slade!” shouted a voice
at the back of the room, and Ned was cheered until
his face grew red with blushes.</p>

<p>It was not long before all the prizes had been
given out. Then followed an entertainment.</p>

<p>“Let’s go back and sit with the girls,” suggested
Ned. The three chums moved down the centre
aisle, and found that the young ladies had anticipated
their coming and had saved seats for them.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[53]</a></span></p>

<p>Mr. Wakefield sought out Jerry and whispered
that his motor-cycle would be ordered at once, and
would probably arrive in the course of a couple
of weeks.</p>

<p>“Isn’t it queer,” said Ned. “Do you remember
that day how we were talking about getting
motor-cycles?”</p>

<p>“I remember,” replied Jerry. “But I didn’t
think I would have one so soon. I wish you and
Bob were going to get them now.”</p>

<p>“I’m going to see if I can’t,” said Ned.</p>

<p>“Same here,” came from the heavy-weight
youth.</p>

<p>The party, increased by late comers, was more
jolly than before, and laughter and jokes made the
hours pass so pleasantly that when twelve o’clock
boomed out on the chiming time-piece of the club,
there was a chorus of cries from the girls.</p>

<p>“Oh! How late it is!” almost screamed Mollie
Horton.</p>

<p>“And mother told me to be sure and be home
by eleven,” came from Alice. “We must start,
girls.”</p>

<p>The majority of boys and girls lived in the same
neighborhood. They paired off, as young folks
will, when they approach the age of sentiment, and
by two marched down the now quiet streets of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[54]</a></span>
Cresville, singing snatches of songs. It was a
bright moon-light night, and the young people enjoyed
every moment of it.</p>

<p>Ned, who had no sister to worry about, had
asked permission to take Alice Vines home. She
lived some distance from the others, though her
route was the same as theirs for a little way.
When it came time for Alice and Ned to take another
path, they bade their companions good-night,
and started off down the street together. Alice
lived about half a mile from the parting of the
ways, and Ned thought the distance all too short.</p>

<p>“I’ve had a very pleasant time,” said Alice,
when she reached her gate. “Thank you very
much for bringing me home.”</p>

<p>“The pleasure was all mine, I assure you,” said
Ned with a gallant bow, whereat Alice laughed.</p>

<p>Then Ned started home alone. His way lay
past the Judson iron mill, a rather lonesome part
of the town, but Ned did not care. Once he
wished he had brought his new rifle along, instead
of leaving it at the club house. Then he laughed
to himself at his fears.</p>

<p>After he had passed his father’s store, which
was in darkness, he came to a part of the town
where there were no street lamps. However the
moon gave considerable light.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[55]</a></span></p>

<p>There were mysterious shadows, too, and once
Ned thought one took on the shape of a man
sneaking around a corner. He came to a halt,
his heart beating wildly.</p>

<p>“Pshaw! It must have been a cloud,” he declared.</p>

<p>A little later he came nearer the iron mill. It
was located on the bank of a river, and the rushing
of the water sounded rather uncanny in the
lonesome night. Once more Ned started as he beheld
a shadow glinting along the street ahead of
him.</p>

<p>“That’s no moon-shadow,” argued the boy.
“That’s the outline of a man, if ever there was
one. And it looked for all the world like Bill
Berry. Well, I don’t know’s I’m afraid of him,
and he certainly isn’t of me.”</p>

<p>He walked on boldly, whistling to keep up his
courage, though he would have disputed that
point had any one accused him. Then he came
in full view of the mill. Through the glass door
of the office he caught sight of a light. He gave
a sudden start and hurried forward.</p>

<hr class="chap" />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[56]</a></span></p>




<h2><a name="CHAPTER_VII" id="CHAPTER_VII">CHAPTER VII.</a><br />
<small>NODDY AND THE SQUARE BOX.</small></h2>


<p>“A light in the mill!” exclaimed Ned softly.
“There must be something wrong. I never saw
one there before. Mr. Judson has no night
watchman either, unless he has gotten one in the
last few days, which I doubt. I wonder what’s
up?”</p>

<p>In spite of the rather disagreeableness of the
task Ned resolved to keep watch for a little while
and see what developed.</p>

<p>He found a stone where he could sit down in the
shadow and observe events. For some time nothing
happened. The little light glowed steadily.
Then it began to flicker and to move about.</p>

<p>Suddenly, off to the left, Ned heard a sound.
It was just as if some one was walking along and
trying to avoid making a noise. Only the breaking
of a little piece of wood now and then, or the
rattle of a pebble, showed that some one was moving.</p>

<p>Ned crouched down behind the stone on which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[57]</a></span>
he had been sitting. He peered forward, straining
his eyes in the uncertain light to catch the least
glimpse of who ever was approaching. He started
as he saw a man, bending low so as to conceal
as much of himself as possible, steal from the yard
of the mill and take up his position on the other
side of the street, about fifty feet from where Ned
was concealed.</p>

<p>“I’m almost certain that was Bill Berry,” whispered
Ned. “I’m positive now that something
wrong is afoot. Bill isn’t out on a night like this
for any good. I wonder if I ought to run for
help?”</p>

<p>For some time Ned kept watchful eyes in the
direction Bill, or the man he supposed was him,
had gone. He could see him, crouched all in a
heap, beside a stone, just as Ned himself was.
And the man seemed to be keeping a watch on
the mill, exactly as Ned was doing.</p>

<p>“Maybe there are robbers in the mill now,”
argued Ned, “and Bill is keeping guard. I’ve a
good notion to go and see if I can’t find a policeman.”</p>

<p>Once more Ned heard a movement in the direction
of the mysterious watcher. He looked and
saw the man straighten up and look cautiously
about him. Then he saw him steal across the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[58]</a></span>
street, go up to the door of the mill office, and
peer in.</p>

<p>“I wish I dared do that,” thought Ned.
“Then I’d know whether I’m making a fool of
myself, staying out like this when I ought to be
in bed.”</p>

<p>For more than a minute Bill Berry, for Ned
could see plainly now that the man was the town
bad character, stood and gazed into the mill office.
Then, apparently satisfied with what he had seen,
Bill tip-toed away and passed down the street and
out of sight.</p>

<p>“Now it’s my turn,” whispered Ned, and he
moved forward.</p>

<p>He looked up. The light was still glowing
though faintly. Ned set his foot on the first
wooden step. As if it had been a signal agreed
upon the light went out suddenly, and the office
was in darkness.</p>

<p>“Queer!” exclaimed Ned. “I wonder if
whoever is in there could have heard me?”</p>

<p>A moment’s reflection, however, showed him this
could not have been the case.</p>

<p>“Maybe they are watching and saw me,” he
argued. This made him feel a little strange. To
think that in the darkness, there might be evil eyes
watching his every movement was not a pleasant<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[59]</a></span>
thought. He knew that he could be seen from
within the mill, though he himself could observe
nothing inside.</p>

<p>“Might as well look in, though, now I’m here,”
he said to himself.</p>

<p>So he boldly, but softly, went up the five steps,
and, placing his hands on either side of his face,
to shut out the little light of the moon that, now
and then, straggled through the clouds, Ned peered
anxiously into the office. As he had feared he
could distinguish nothing. It was as black as the
proverbial pocket.</p>

<p>Ned walked down the steps. As he did so he
thought he heard, from within the mill, a sound, as
if a door was slammed. He listened intently.</p>

<p>“I guess I must have fancied it,” he said. “I
must be getting nervous. That won’t do. All
the same I would like to have seen what Bill Berry
did when he looked in while the light was there.”</p>

<p>With this thought in mind Ned moved off.
The iron mill took up quite a large space of
ground, what would be termed a city block, and
there were streets on three sides of it, besides a
road along the river, between the stream and the
mill. A high fence surrounded all but the front
of the mill, though there were gates in it at intervals
to admit the workmen and teams. To get to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[60]</a></span>
his home Ned had to go to the farthest end of
the mill fence, and turn up a street there. He was
walking toward the corner, and was close to it,
when he heard footsteps approaching.</p>

<p>He hesitated a moment. Then he reflected that
he had as much right to be where he was as any
one. The footsteps came nearer and nearer.
Then, as Ned proceeded he turned the corner, and
came face to face with Noddy Nixon!</p>

<p>Just then the moon, which had been hidden by
a cloud, came out brightly. By its gleam Ned
could distinguish the bully’s features clearly. They
bore a look of mingled rage and fear.</p>

<p>“Hello, Noddy,” said Ned, resolving in spite
of all that had taken place, to speak friendly.
“Fine night, isn’t it?”</p>

<p>“Look here!” burst out Noddy. “Are you
spying on me? Can’t I go to the river to get
some fish bait without having every young cub in
Cresville at my heels?”</p>

<p>“I wasn’t spying on you, as you call it,” said
Ned quietly, “and if you think so the less I have
to say to you the better off I’ll be.”</p>

<p>“I’ve a mind to knock your head off,” spluttered
Noddy. “Just mind your own business or
you’ll get into trouble, and it will be a kind you
won’t like.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[61]</a></span></p>

<p>Ned did not deem the remarks worthy of an answer.
He turned and was hurrying past. As he
did so he noticed that Noddy held tightly under
one arm a small square box. It seemed to be made
of wood. Catching Ned’s glance at what he carried,
Noddy rapidly shifted the box until it was
hidden under his coat. Then, with angry mutterings,
he hurried on.</p>

<p>“Rather a queer sort of box to use for his fish
bait,” thought Ned. “I wonder what he was
up to, any how? And I wonder what that light
in the mill meant? I’ve had quite a few adventures
to-night. Guess I’d better get home before
I meet with any more.”</p>

<p>So he walked rapidly on, and reached his house
without further incident. He soon fell asleep, to
dream of being shut up in a small square wooden
box with a big fish, while Noddy Nixon, on a motor-cycle,
was riding off rapidly with the box under
his arm.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_VIII" id="CHAPTER_VIII">CHAPTER VIII.</a><br />
<small>THE MILL MYSTERY.</small></h2>


<p>“Have you heard the news&mdash;great excitement&mdash;big
robbery&mdash;everybody talking about it&mdash;hurry
up!”</p>

<p>It was thus Andy Rush greeted Ned the next
morning as he stopped at the latter’s house on the
way down town. Andy’s hair was more disarranged
than ever, and his blue eyes fairly shone.</p>

<p>“What’s up?” asked Ned, who had come to
the door in answer to Andy’s whistle, having been
met with the flow of words that startled him.</p>

<p>“Last night&mdash;midnight, I guess&mdash;Judson’s
mill&mdash;thousand dollars&mdash;great excitement&mdash;safe
blown open&mdash;money taken&mdash;detectives notified&mdash;I’m
off to see the fun&mdash;hurry up!”</p>

<p>“Hold on!” called Ned. “I saw&mdash;I know&mdash;”
and then he stopped. The memory of what
he had seen in the night; the light in the mill, the
actions of Bill Berry, and his meeting with Noddy
Nixon, who carried a square box; all this came to
Ned in an instant. He was about to tell Andy,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[63]</a></span>
but on second thought decided that he had better
keep his own counsel, at least, for a while.</p>

<p>“Coming along?&mdash;no time to lose!” cried
Andy.</p>

<p>“I’ll be down after I have breakfast,” replied
Ned, waving a farewell to Andy, and returning to
the house sorely puzzled.</p>

<p>He ate his breakfast rapidly. He hardly knew
what to do in reference to what he had witnessed
during his watch at the mill. After some thought
he decided to wait a little while, learn more particulars
of the robbery, and then relate everything
to his father.</p>

<p>In a little while Mr. Slade left the house and
Ned soon followed. When the lad reached the
centre of the town it needed no one to tell him
that there was considerable excitement. In a small
place like Cresville news spreads quickly even without
a daily paper.</p>

<p>Ned soon found his chums, Bob and Jerry.</p>

<p>“Have you heard about it?” demanded Ned.</p>

<p>“Yes, Andy Rush told me,” said Jerry.</p>

<p>“And he told me, too,” put in Bob. “That
fellow is as swift as his name.”</p>

<p>“Did you hear any particulars?” demanded
Ned.</p>

<p>“It was an old-fashioned safe, according to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[64]</a></span>
what the policeman told me,” said Jerry, “and the
burglars had little trouble in getting it open.”</p>

<p>“Did they blow it apart?”</p>

<p>“No, simply took a chisel and hammer and cut
the lock out. The door was only soft iron.”</p>

<p>By this time the three boys were near the mill.
There was quite a crowd about, and several policemen
were on guard, preventing any one, but
those having business, from entering the establishment.</p>

<p>“One side, please,” called a man suddenly, coming
up behind the three chums. “I’m in a hurry.”</p>

<p>The boys turned aside, to give passage to a
short, stout fussy man, who seemed in a tremendous
state of excitement.</p>

<p>“That’s Sheriff Blackwell,” said Jerry. “I
suppose he thinks the robbers are here waiting for
him to arrest them.”</p>

<p>There was really little news of the robbery to be
had. Mr. Judson related what particulars he
knew to the police.</p>

<p>“I had a little more than one thousand dollars
on hand late yesterday afternoon,” he said to the
officers. “Several people paid me some bills, and,
as it was late, I didn’t go to the bank, but locked
the money up in the safe. I seldom do this, as
the iron box is no match for burglars.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[65]</a></span></p>

<p>“As far as I know the only persons who knew
the money was in the safe were my son and myself.
I am sure neither he nor I told any one.”</p>

<p>“We must get right to work looking up clues,”
said the sheriff.</p>

<p>But there were apparently no clues. As has
been said, the door of the safe was of soft iron.
The robber, or robbers, had used a cold chisel and
a hammer, and cut out a section of the door around
the big clumsy lock. Then it was a comparatively
easy matter to get at the cash. The thieves had
left nothing behind them that would throw any
light on the mystery.</p>

<p>Having learned all they could, and seeing that
there were likely to be no developments at the mill,
the three chums wandered up the street. All the
while Ned was busy thinking. Finally he said:</p>

<p>“Boys, I’ve something to tell you. I want to
ask your advice. It’s about the robbery. Come
where we can find a quiet place.”</p>

<p>Soon the three chums were sitting comfortably
beneath a big oak tree, that cast a pleasant shade
from the sun, which was already hot, though it was
early in the day.</p>

<p>“Now, let’s hear the yarn,” said Chunky.</p>

<p>Thereupon Ned told what he had seen while
watching the mill the previous night.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[66]</a></span></p>

<p>“Well, I should say you did know something
about the robbery,” commented Jerry. “Why
didn’t you tell this to the police?”</p>

<p>“I did think of it,” said Ned. “But I wanted
to get some advice first. You see the light may
or may not have had a connection with the crime.”</p>

<p>“Yes, but it looks suspicious, seeing Bill Berry
around,” came from Bob.</p>

<p>“Are you sure it was him?” asked Jerry.</p>

<p>“As sure as I am that I’m talking to you now.”</p>

<p>“And are you just as positive that it was Noddy?”</p>

<p>“Even more so. Wasn’t I talking to him?”</p>

<p>“And he said he had fish bait in the square
box?”</p>

<p>“He didn’t exactly say so, but he intimated as
much.”</p>

<p>“If it was fish bait, why should he try to hide
it, as you say he did?” asked Jerry.</p>

<p>“That’s what puzzles me,” replied Ned. “I
only wish I had seen what Bill saw in the mill
office when the light was burning.”</p>

<p>“Maybe Bill is the robber,” suggested Bob.</p>

<p>“I hardly think so,” was Ned’s opinion. “He
may have had some connection with it, and may
even have known about it. But, in my opinion the
person who took the thousand dollars was the person<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[67]</a></span>
who had the light in the office, and that wasn’t
Bill.”</p>

<p>“Do you&mdash;do you think Noddy&mdash;er&mdash;Noddy
took the money?” asked Bob in a hesitating
tone. He felt rather delicate about accusing
an acquaintance, even one so undesirable as Noddy,
of a serious crime.</p>

<p>“Well, I hate to think so, but it does look suspicious,”
said Ned. “He certainly acted afraid
because he met me.”</p>

<p>“Could any one get out of the office any way
except going through the front door?” asked Bob.</p>

<p>“Yes,” replied Ned. “There is a back door
that goes out into the mill yard. From the yard
a person could pass onto the road along the river,
and then come up along the north side of the
mill fence, on Peterson street.”</p>

<p>“And it was at the corner of Peterson street
and Maple alley that you met Noddy, wasn’t it?”</p>

<p>“That’s just where it was.”</p>

<p>There was silence for a few minutes among the
boys. Each one was busy with disagreeable
thoughts.</p>

<p>“Did any of you hear how the mill office door
was opened?” asked Ned.</p>

<p>“The lock wasn’t forced on either the back or
front door,” answered Jerry. “So I was told.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[68]</a></span>
The police think the robber used a skeleton key.”</p>

<p>“Then it comes right down to a question. Is
Noddy Nixon guilty?” asked Bob solemnly.</p>

<p>“It’s hard to decide,” replied Ned. “I’d hate
to accuse any one, even when things look as suspicious
as they do now. Do you think I ought
to tell the police? Perhaps they will arrest both
Bill and Noddy on suspicion.”</p>

<p>“You’d have to be a witness against them, and
that would not be very pleasant,” suggested Jerry.
“Besides their word would be as good as
yours in court, and you have no proof. I think
the best thing to do is to wait a while. If suspicion
points more strongly to Noddy or Bill, then
you can come forward and tell what you know.”</p>

<p>“Then I’ll wait a while,” said Ned. “In the
meantime we can, all three, have an eye on Noddy
and Bill. They may do something or say something
that would give us a clue.”</p>

<p>“There’s another thing I don’t believe any of
us have thought of,” came from Jerry.</p>

<p>“What’s that?”</p>

<p>“Why, you know, Mr. Nixon, Noddy’s father,
owns several shares in Judson’s mill.”</p>

<p>“Are you sure of that?” asked Ned.</p>

<p>“Positive. I heard mother saying something
about it the other day. It seems the concern was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[69]</a></span>
made a stock company not long ago, and Mr. Judson
wanted mother to invest some of her money
in it. He remarked at the time that Mr. Nixon
had taken ten shares of the stock, and thought it a
good investment.”</p>

<p>“That might or might not throw additional suspicion
on Noddy,” remarked Ned. “If he knew
his father was interested, financially, in the iron
mill, he hardly would take money that he knew
might cause his father a loss.”</p>

<p>“Well, all this talking don’t bring matters any
nearer a solution,” said Jerry, finally. “I think
all we can do is to wait and watch.”</p>

<p>“And meet every day to compare notes,” suggested
Ned.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_IX" id="CHAPTER_IX">CHAPTER IX.</a><br />
<small>THE QUEER BANK BILL.</small></h2>


<p>It was the afternoon of the day the robbery of
the mill was discovered. Ned, after his conference
with his two chums, had gone down to his
father’s store. He wanted to talk to Mr. Slade
about the prospects of getting a motor-cycle. For,
now that Jerry was about to get one, the desire on
Ned’s part was all the stronger.</p>

<p>While standing in the front of the big department
establishment his father owned Ned was surprised
to see, passing on the other side of the
street, Noddy Nixon and Paul Banner.</p>

<p>“That’s queer,” commented Ned. “I didn’t
know Noddy and Paul were as chummy as that.
They didn’t used to have much use for each other.”</p>

<p>Then the idea suddenly came to him, that here
was the very opportunity he desired. He could
follow Noddy and Paul, and see if he might learn
anything.</p>

<p>The bully and the dude, as Ned could observe
from time to time, did not seem to be exactly in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[71]</a></span>
accord. At times they would almost come to a
halt, and dispute over something. Noddy seemed
to be objecting to some course of action proposed
by Paul.</p>

<p>“They must be going to the old wind mill,”
commented Ned, as he saw Noddy and Paul turn
down a street that led to an old-fashioned, and deserted
flour mill, that, in by-gone days, had been
operated by wind power. The mill was a good
distance from the edge of the town, in the centre
of a big field.</p>

<p>Sure enough that was the destination of the two
young men. Ned was as close after them as he
dared to go. There was little risk of his being
noticed while he was on the streets, but, after leaving
them there was greater danger of detection for
the trailer.</p>

<p>“However,” argued Ned, “as long as I know
where they are going, I don’t need to keep so close
after them. I can wait until they get to the mill,
and then I can go there too. By coming up from
the back, where there are no windows, which I can
do by going through Hedges’s Lane, they can’t see
me.”</p>

<p>He approached the mill rapidly from the rear.
As he came within hearing distance he could distinguish
voices. And they seemed to be disputing.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[72]</a></span>
The ancient establishment was full of cracks
and broken places, and the noise from inside
passed out freely. Nearer and nearer hurried
Ned. At last he reached the broad platform that
ran all around the base of the mill. He proceeded
cautiously, taking care not to step in the big
holes that yawned here and there. He crept
around to a place near the front entrance to the
old structure. Fortunately here he found where
a board had come loose, so that it afforded a good
listening place.</p>

<p>“I don’t see what in the world you wanted to
bring me all the way out to this lonely place for,
my dear chap,” Paul was saying.</p>

<p>“It’s this way,” Noddy was explaining. “I
told you I was short of cash, and had to ask you
to wait until to-day to pay the bet I made with
you.”</p>

<p>“But, my dear fellow,” “Polly” expostulated,
“why couldn’t you pay me up there in town, just
as well?”</p>

<p>“To tell you the truth,” said Noddy, in a tone
that would indicate to any one who knew him that
he was going to do just the opposite, “I didn’t
want any one to see me paying you.”</p>

<p>“And why not, pray, my dear chap?”</p>

<p>“Because I owe quite a few bets,” replied<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[73]</a></span>
Noddy. “I am going to square them all up in
a day or so, but if those I owe saw me paying you
they would all come down on me at once and I
would be financially embarrassed. I suppose
you’re ready to take the money now?”</p>

<p>“Ready, nay, anxious, my dear chap.”</p>

<p>“Well, I had a little trouble in getting it,” went
on Noddy, not going into particulars, however.
“And here it is. Just one hundred dollars, isn’t
it?”</p>

<p>“Correct, my dear boy.”</p>

<p>“Ten fives are fifty,” said Noddy, counting out
some bills, “and twenty is seventy. Twenty more
is ninety, and that ten makes just the hundred.”</p>

<p>“Hold on here!” exclaimed Paul, when Noddy
had come to the end of his counting. “This bill
doesn’t look just right.”</p>

<p>“Which bill?”</p>

<p>“This last ten dollar one. I never saw one
like it.”</p>

<p>“Nonsense, that’s all right,” responded Noddy.
“Let’s see it.”</p>

<p>Paul passed it back.</p>

<p>“Why, certainly it’s good,” Noddy said. “It’s
a state bank bill, instead of a national one, that’s
all. Issued by the Merchants’ Bank of Boston.”</p>

<p>“But what’s that queer red mark on it?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[74]</a></span></p>

<p>Noddy examined it more closely. Then he
laughed.</p>

<p>“Some one has gone to the trouble of marking
his initials on it in red ink,” he said. “Probably
for identification, or to serve as a mark.
Maybe it was once used as a marked bill,” and
Noddy gave a short laugh. “See, there are the
letters H. R. C.”</p>

<p>“I guess you’re right,” agreed Paul. “Well,
hand it over. I must be going. Sorry you lost
the bet, but losers must pay, you know.”</p>

<p>“Oh, I’m not squealing,” retorted Noddy.</p>

<p>“Guess I’ll be going,” went on Paul. “Beastly
long walk back to town.”</p>

<p>Ned was glad to hear the sound of departing
footsteps. He kept in hiding for five minutes,
however, fearing Noddy might return. At the
end of that time he ventured out. He saw Noddy
and Paul almost across the field and knew he was
safe.</p>

<p>Ned hurried back to town, going the same
roundabout path he had taken in coming. He
hastened to Jerry’s house and told him what had
taken place, and the two hunted up Bob and related
the events to him.</p>

<p>“Things are getting warm,” commented Bob.</p>

<p>“They are that,” replied Jerry.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[75]</a></span></p>

<p>“I wonder if one of us couldn’t get a talk with
‘Polly’ Banner?” suggested Jerry. “We might
manage to get talking about queer bills, and
‘Polly’ would show us the one he had.”</p>

<p>“Suppose you try that,” Bob said.</p>

<p>“I’m willing,” Jerry responded. “I’ll take a
walk down town now, and maybe I’ll meet him.
You wait until I come back.”</p>

<p>Jerry resolved to first visit the club house of
the athletic organization, as he knew Paul spent
a good deal of his time there. Sure enough, he
found Paul sitting at ease in a comfortable chair,
smoking a perfumed cigarette and reading a book.</p>

<p>“I say, Paul,” said Jerry, “you’re not interested
in old coins are you?”</p>

<p>“Old coins? No, my dear chap; why should
I be interested in old coins?”</p>

<p>“Oh, I don’t know. I was just wondering.
Some people collect old coins, and some stamps.
I favor stamps, myself.”</p>

<p>“Now that you speak of it,” said Paul, “I remember
I have an old bill about me. It’s rather
odd. Maybe you’d be interested in it.”</p>

<p>“Let’s see,” replied Jerry, thanking his stars
that he was about to accomplish his purpose so
easily.</p>

<p>Paul drew out the odd ten dollar note Noddy<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[76]</a></span>
had given him. Just as Ned had reported, it
was an old style state bank note. And, in one of
the blank spaces on the reverse side some one had
made a very elaborate monogram of the initials H.
R. C.</p>

<p>“Quite a curiosity,” observed Jerry, passing the
bill back.</p>

<p>“I think so,” said Paul, puffing out thick clouds
of smoke from his Egyptian cigarette. “But I
suppose there is no premium on it.”</p>

<p>“There might be,” replied Jerry in as careless
a tone as he could assume. “If I were you I’d
save it and see.”</p>

<p>“I will,” said Paul. “I’ll place it in the very
back part of my wallet, and I won’t spend it until
I see a coin catalog. That’s an easy way to make
money.”</p>

<p>“Where did you get the bill?” asked Jerry.
“Perhaps you can get more.”</p>

<p>“Noddy Nixon gave it to me,” responded
Paul. “I wasn’t going to take it at first, but he
told me it was good.”</p>

<p>“Oh, I reckon it’s good enough,” answered
Jerry. “Well, I guess I’ll be traveling. Good-bye,
Paul.”</p>

<p>“Good afternoon, my dear chap,” answered
Paul, lighting another cigarette.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[77]</a></span></p>

<p>“I’ll not forget how that bill looks,” said Jerry
to himself, as he sought his two chums and told
them what had taken place between Paul and himself.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_X" id="CHAPTER_X">CHAPTER X.</a><br />
<small>THE MOTOR-CYCLE.</small></h2>


<p>It was about a week after the foregoing events
when Jerry received a letter, bearing in the upper
left-hand corner of the envelope the mark of the
C. H. &amp; D. Railroad.</p>

<p>He read the missive, which was short and to
the point. Briefly it informed Jerry that there
awaited him at the freight office of the road one
motor-cycle, which he could have by calling and
presenting the enclosed way-bill.</p>

<p>“Hurrah!” shouted the boy. “Three cheers
for the Cresville Athletic Club and Mr. Wakefield!
Hurrah!”</p>

<p>Jerry lost no time in calling for his two chums,
and the three boys hurried together to the freight
depot.</p>

<p>“What can I do for you boys?” asked Mr.
Hitter, the agent in charge.</p>

<p>“I come to get what that calls for,” replied
Jerry, handing over the way-bill.</p>

<p>“Oh, yes, one of them new-fangled bicycles that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[79]</a></span>
take a steam engine to run ’em. Well, you’ll find
it down at the end of the platform,” said Mr.
Hitter. “Now, be careful, and don’t blow yourself
up. Boys is dreadful careless like,” he muttered,
as he went on with his work.</p>

<p>Boxed in a big crate, at the end of the freight
platform, the boys found the motor-cycle. It was
addressed in big letters to “Jerry Hopkins, Esq.,”
and marked “With Care.”</p>

<p>“Shall I unpack it here or get it taken up to
the house, crate and all?” asked Jerry of his
chums.</p>

<p>“Oh, unpack it here. Then you can ride it
home,” said Bob.</p>

<p>“I know about as much how to ride one as I
would how to run a locomotive,” objected Jerry.
“I’ve studied the catalogs, of course, but I think
I’d better start it up at home first.”</p>

<p>“Oh, go ahead, ride it home,” put in Ned.
“We can manage to find out how it works, and we
can get some gasolene over to the drug store.”</p>

<p>So, rather against his own calmer judgment,
Jerry decided to do as his friends wished. He
borrowed a hammer from Mr. Hitter and soon the
crate was broken apart and the motor-cycle, in all
its mechanical beauty, was revealed.</p>

<p>It certainly was a fine machine and had all the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[80]</a></span>
latest improvements. There were two cylinders
instead of one, insuring great speed; the tires were
large, and there was a large reservoir for gasolene.
It was of the latest make and not generally
on the market as yet.</p>

<p>“Here’s a book that tells all about how to run
it,” said Bob, catching sight of a pamphlet of directions.</p>

<p>The boys read the directions over carefully. It
seemed simple enough. All there was to do was
to put some gasolene in the tank, see that the batteries
gave a proper current, start the machine off,
turn on the gasolene, switch on the spark and
ride off.</p>

<p>“I’ll get the gasolene,” volunteered Ned. He
ran over to the drug store and came back with a
can full.</p>

<p>“Now try and see if there’s a good spark,”
Jerry suggested.</p>

<p>Satisfied that the batteries were in working order,
Jerry prepared to take his first ride. The
street leading from the railroad depot was a long
straight wide one.</p>

<p>“It’s a good thing,” commented Jerry, referring
to the highway. “There’s plenty of chance to
be run away with, and not damage anything. I
can ride clear to New York if I go far enough.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[81]</a></span></p>

<p>“I wouldn’t this time, though,” said Bob.</p>

<p>Jerry smiled. It was a rather dubious sort of a
grin, to be sure. Much as he wanted a motor-cycle,
he knew there was a little risk in riding one
when he was not thoroughly familiar with it.
However, he wasn’t going to back out. He got
on the ponderous machine, which Bob and Ned
steadied for him.</p>

<p>“Give me a little shove.”</p>

<p>Bob and Ned did so.</p>

<p>“Work the pedals and get a good start,” advised
Bob.</p>

<p>Jerry did so. Soon he was moving off at a fair
speed, though, of course, just as if he was on an
ordinary bicycle.</p>

<p>“Turn on the gasolene!” shouted Ned.</p>

<p>“And throw in the spark!” called Bob.</p>

<p>“Here she goes,” Jerry yelled back.</p>

<p>There was a series of sharp explosions, like a
machine gun being fired at top speed, and the motor-cycle,
with Jerry aboard, started off.</p>

<p>“Hurrah!” shouted Ned and Bob.</p>

<p>Bang! Bang! Bang! the machine went, and
soon Jerry was a quarter of a mile down the road.</p>

<p>“He ought to shut off the exhaust,” commented
Bob. “He can do that on this machine. On
some you can’t.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[82]</a></span></p>

<p>The two boys, thinking of nothing but motor-cycles
and their chances of getting them, passed
down the road. Jerry was out of sight. In a
little while they espied a cloud of dust down the
highway. It seemed to be moving toward them.</p>

<p>“Here comes Jerry, I guess,” Bob said.</p>

<p>“And he’s moving like the wind!” exclaimed
Ned.</p>

<p>In a few minutes the dust cloud was nearer, and
then the boys saw that it was Jerry approaching at
a rapid rate. His machine did not make so much
noise now. But, as he came nearer, Bob and
Ned, who caught a glimpse of his face, thought
he looked a little worried.</p>

<p>“Hold on! Can’t you stop?” cried Bob, for
Jerry was about to pass.</p>

<p>“That’s the trouble!” Jerry yelled as he
whizzed past. “I can’t seem to shut off the
power!”</p>

<p>Then he was lost in a cloud of dust, going
down the road in the opposite direction.</p>

<p>“Something’s wrong!” Bob ejaculated.</p>

<p>“He’s forgotten which lever to pull!” exclaimed
Ned. “If he don’t look out there’ll be
trouble.”</p>

<p>As he spoke Jerry came flying back.</p>

<p>“Can’t one of you do something?” he cried.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[83]</a></span>
“I’m afraid to take my hands off the bars long
enough to pull the levers again, and the last time
I yanked them I seemed to turn on more power.
I’ll ride down the road a way and turn back.
Think up something in the meanwhile!”</p>

<p>“He’s in a pickle!” exclaimed Ned.</p>

<p>“I have it!” cried Bob.</p>

<p>“What?”</p>

<p>“The next time he comes past yell at him to
ride around in a circle until we can look in the
book of directions on how to run a motor-cycle.”</p>

<p>And so, the next time Jerry whizzed by, with
a comical worried look on his face, Bob yelled:</p>

<p>“Ride around us in a circle, Jerry. Make believe
you’re on the track. Ned and I will look
in the book and see how to stop you!”</p>

<p>Jerry obeyed. Around and around he went,
the machine kicking up a cloud of dust. In the
centre of the ring stood Bob and Ned, poring
over the pages of the book.</p>

<p>“There it is!” cried Ned, pointing to something
on one page.</p>

<p>“What does it say?” asked Bob.</p>

<p>“To stop the machine pull lever A and throw
off B toward you three notches,” read Ned.</p>

<p>“Pull lever A and throw off B toward you three
notches!” Bob yelled to Jerry.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[84]</a></span></p>

<p>“Which is lever A and which is lever B?”
asked Jerry. “They’re not marked on the machine.”</p>

<p>“That’s so, I forgot that,” admitted Ned.</p>

<p>“What am I going to do?” begged Jerry.
“Have I got to ride around like this all night?”</p>

<p>“What’s in the name of Tunket is the trouble?”
asked Mr. Hitter, the station agent, who was on
his way down the road, and who had come to
where Jerry was riding around in a circle with
Bob and Ned in the centre.</p>

<p>“He can’t stop!” cried Ned and Bob at once.</p>

<p>“I knowed there’d some trouble come of that
machine,” said Mr. Hitter, shaking his head. “I
told you not to monkey with ’em. It all comes of
man trying to improve on nature. Walking’s
good enough for me. What particular form of
trouble does the critter seem to be suffering from?
I mean the motor-cycle.”</p>

<p>“There’s two levers,” explained Bob. “One
is A and the other is B, according to the book.
The trouble is they are not marked on the machine,
and Jerry don’t know which one to pull.”</p>

<p>“Well, not knowing much about the case, I
would advise him to pull ’em both,” said Mr.
Hitter. “He can’t be any worse off than he is
now, and maybe it’ll stop him.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[85]</a></span></p>

<p>“Good!” exclaimed Bob. “That’s it. Why
didn’t we think of that?”</p>

<p>“Why didn’t we?” was all Ned could say.</p>

<p>Then they both shouted to Jerry, who was still
pursuing his weary round:</p>

<p>“Move both levers, Jerry!”</p>

<p>Jerry did so. In an instant the motor-cycle
ceased the explosions, and, in a little while it
slowed down so that Jerry could dismount.</p>

<p>“Well, that certainly was an experience,” commented
Jerry, as he wiped the dust from his face.
“But it was fun all the same,” he added, whereat
Mr. Hitter laughed.</p>

<p>“Boys will be boys,” the station agent muttered
as he went off down the road.</p>

<p>“Funny the machine got such a fit on,” said
Ned, examining the motor-cycle closely. “I
didn’t think they would act like that.”</p>

<p>“Here’s the difficulty,” cried Bob, who was
also looking over the apparatus. “This piece of
wire ought to have been taken off. It was put
on temporarily when the machine was packed.
See, it held the gasolene lever and the spark one
also, so they couldn’t come back separately. You
had to pull them both at once to shut off the flow
of fluid and the current of electricity. It’s a thing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[86]</a></span>
that wouldn’t happen if we hadn’t been in such a
hurry.”</p>

<p>“Well, it all came out right,” said Jerry. “I’m
going to ride the machine home.”</p>

<p>And he did without further mishap, stopping
and starting the motor without trouble, now that
the wire was off.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XI" id="CHAPTER_XI">CHAPTER XI.</a><br />
<small>MACHINES FOR BOB AND NED.</small></h2>


<p>That night two very earnest lads implored two
fathers to purchase motor-cycles for them. As
Bob and Ned were both sons of well-to-do parents
the matter was not much one of cost.</p>

<p>“To tell you the truth,” said Mr. Baker to
Bob. “I’m a little afraid of those machines.
They are dangerous.”</p>

<p>“I’ll be careful,” pleaded Bob.</p>

<p>“I know, but that’s what every one says at
first,” objected Mr. Baker.</p>

<p>At the same time the same sort of a conversation
was going on in the Slade household.</p>

<p>“You say there’s no danger,” Mr. Slade was
remarking in answer to Ned’s statement to that
effect. “But I heard about Jerry Hopkins and
his experience this afternoon. It seems to me
there was danger there.”</p>

<p>It was three days before the two fathers arrived
at a decision. They had consulted in the
meanwhile, and Jerry’s machine had been closely<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[88]</a></span>
examined. Bob and Ned had both taken turns
on it, and showed that, after a little practice, they
could run it perfectly. Jerry, also, had become
quite expert.</p>

<p>In the meantime the boys were so engrossed
with the idea of motor-cycles that they had almost
forgotten about the mill robbery. They met, according
to appointment, under the tree in the
woods, but there was nothing new to tell. With
the discovery of the queer bank bill, and the
knowledge that Paul Banner was saving it, the
boys resolved to let the matter rest for a while.</p>

<p>The police and detectives, and even the fussy
sheriff, had discovered nothing, save that the
money was gone, which every one knew. As for
Noddy, he did not act like a guilty person. Bill
Berry had disappeared for the time being.</p>

<p>Noddy seemed to have plenty of money. He
was careful not to apply to his father again, however,
and the source of his supply was a mystery
except to himself. In about a week Mr. Nixon,
of his own accord, gave Noddy two hundred dollars.</p>

<p>“I hope you will spend it wisely, my son,” he
said. “It is wicked to waste money, when so
much good can be done with it.”</p>

<p>“I say, father,” began Bob to Mr. Baker one<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[89]</a></span>
evening, a little more than a week after the time
Jerry had received his prize motor-cycle, “have
you thought any more about that machine for
me?”</p>

<p>“I have made up my mind,” went on Mr.
Baker, with exasperating slowness, “that you can
not&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Oh, father!” burst out Bob.</p>

<p>“That you can not get along without one,”
finished the banker with a laugh, “and so I have
ordered one for you.”</p>

<p>“Thanks dad!” was all Bob could say, but the
two words meant a good deal.</p>

<p>At the same time, according to arrangement between
Mr. Baker and Mr. Slade, the latter was
announcing to his son Ned, that he could have
the much-wanted machine. If there were two
happier boys than Ned and Bob in Cresville that
night, no one knew where to find them.</p>

<p>“We’ll have lots of sport,” said Bob. “I
know of a dozen trips we can take, that would be
too long for a bicycle.”</p>

<p>Three days later the two motor-cycles came,
and the chums could hardly wait to unpack them.
Bob’s and Ned’s machines were just like Jerry’s
except in a few minor points.</p>

<p>Jerry was delighted that his chums’ machines<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[90]</a></span>
had arrived. He got his own out and soon all
three were speeding down the road. In point of
fastness there was not much to choose from
among the three motors. None of the boys had
risked running the cycles at top speed yet, and
at the half-way mark each one developed about the
same swiftness.</p>

<p>The boys rode for several miles. It was a
pleasant day, with a bright sun overhead, while
an early morning shower had laid the dust. After
an hour’s travel Bob said:</p>

<p>“I don’t know about the rest of you, but I’m
hungry.”</p>

<p>In a few minutes they stopped their motor-cycles
in front of a big white farm house, and walked
up the path to the side door.</p>

<p>On the porch they found a motherly looking
woman churning. She smiled at the sight of the
three boys, and took off her apron, which was
splashed with butter-milk, as she came forward
to greet them.</p>

<p>“Good-afternoon,” she said pleasantly.</p>

<p>“We stopped to see if we could get something
to eat,” began Jerry. “We’re willing to pay for
it, of course,” he added, fearing the woman might
think they were tramps. “Anything will do.
Some cookies, a little milk or a piece of pie.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[91]</a></span></p>

<p>“I guess I can fix you something,” said the
woman. “Hi! You Jason!” she called in a
loud voice. “Come and run this churn while I
set out a lunch for some visitors.”</p>

<p>In answer to her hail an old man shuffled
around the corner of the house.</p>

<p>“I’m comin’,” he said in a quavering voice.
“I’m a leetle mite slow, ’cause the rheumatiz
catches me to-day, Alvirah. But I’m comin’.”</p>

<p>“It’s my grand uncle,” the woman explained to
the boys. “He’s almost ninety years old, but he
can churn as good as I can. Can’t you, Jason.”</p>

<p>“I reckon so, Alvirah.”</p>

<p>While the farmer’s wife bustled around to set
out a simple meal for the boys, the latter sat out
on the porch watching old Jason chum. He
moved the dasher up and down, a queer chugging
sound following each stroke.</p>

<p>“How did you come, anyhow? Walk?”
asked the old man presently.</p>

<p>“On motor-cycles,” replied Ned.</p>

<p>“I didn’t know they had them flyin’ machines
in working order yit,” exclaimed the old man.</p>

<p>“Come on, boys,” interrupted the farmer’s
wife. “I have a little something here for you.”</p>

<p>The “little something” proved to be quite a
meal. There was nice fresh bread, with the best<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[92]</a></span>
butter the boys had ever eaten. There was also
honey right from the bee hives, some rich milk, a
plate of doughnuts and cheese, and two big pies,
one apple and the other peach.</p>

<p>“This is very kind of you,” said Jerry. “We
didn’t want you to go to all this trouble.”</p>

<p>“I’m sure it’s no trouble,” replied the woman.
“I’m glad you came along. It’s rather lonesome
out this way. We don’t often have company.”</p>

<p>The boys ate with a will. When they had finished
there was not much left on the table.</p>

<p>“How much do we owe you?” asked Jerry, as
he and his chums rose in preparation to continue
their journey.</p>

<p>“Oh, I reckon ten cents will be about right,”
was the answer. But Jerry insisted on paying
twenty-five cents for each, and, after some argument,
the woman accepted it.</p>

<p>Soon the boys were well on the road toward
Cresville. They talked of many things, and
planned several trips in the near future. As they
turned into the main road leading to their homes
they heard a chugging sound behind them.</p>

<p>All three came to a halt, dismounted, and sat
down under a tree. Nearer and nearer came the
sound of the approaching motor-cycle. Then, in
a cloud of dust, a solitary rider whizzed past.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[93]</a></span></p>

<p>“Did you see who that was?” asked Ned.
“Noddy Nixon.”</p>

<p>“Are you sure?”</p>

<p>“Positive. I heard the other day that he was
going to get a machine. That was him, sure
enough.”</p>

<p>“I don’t think he goes so very fast,” observed
Jerry.</p>

<p>“He does, all the same,” was Bob’s opinion.
“You can make up your mind Noddy will have
as fast a machine as there is built.”</p>

<p>“I suppose he bought it with some of the proceeds
of the mill robbery,” cried Jerry.</p>

<p>“Hush!” cried Ned. “Don’t say such things.
Some one might hear you and it would make
trouble. Besides, we have not proved Noddy
guilty yet.”</p>

<p>“Well,” said Bob with a shrug of his shoulders,
“I hope we don’t meet him very often when
we are out on the road. He’s not the most pleasant
fellow in the world.”</p>

<p>“There’s not much danger of his seeking our
company,” came from Jerry. “He is not overfond
of any of us.”</p>

<p>The three boys rested for a while beneath the
tree and then, as the sun sank, they mounted their
cycles, put on good speed, and arrived home in time<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[94]</a></span>
for supper, bearing excellent appetites, in spite of
the good meal they had had at the farm house.</p>

<hr class="chap" />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[95]</a></span></p>




<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XII" id="CHAPTER_XII">CHAPTER XII.</a><br />
<small>A WILD NIGHT RIDE.</small></h2>


<p>“I say, Jerry,” began Bob, dismounting from
his motor-cycle one afternoon in front of his
chum’s house, “what do you say to a night ride?”</p>

<p>“You mean on our machines?”</p>

<p>“Sure. Let’s get acetylene gas lamps, that give
a good light, and ride over to Fallsburg and back.
We can start in the evening and easily make the
round trip in five or six hours.”</p>

<p>Fallsburg was a town about the size of Cresville
and forty miles distant therefrom. The road between
was a fairly good one most of the way, and,
by making a circuit involving about five miles more
of travel an excellent highway for the whole distance
was available.</p>

<p>It was decided to start right after supper, and
the chums calculated they could make Fallsburg in
about three hours. They did not intend to ride
fast, and were out for pleasure rather than for
speed.</p>

<p>Without special incident the trip to Fallsburg<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[96]</a></span>
was concluded. It was nine o’clock when the
boys reached the town, which was quite a lively
place. Considerable of a stir was caused when our
three heroes rode in on their machines, which were
somewhat of a novelty there.</p>

<p>“Hurrah! I see an ice cream sign!” exclaimed
Ned, pointing down the street.</p>

<p>Little time was lost in getting to the store and
after each had put away a large plate of the frozen
stuff the boys felt better. The tables in the ice
cream parlor were separated one from the other by
large screens. In the improvised apartment just
back of where the three boys were sitting, voices in
low conversation could be heard.</p>

<p>“Are you sure Noddy will be there?” was the
cautious inquiry that came to the ears of our heroes.
At the sound of that name all three started.</p>

<p>“He’ll be there if his machine doesn’t break,
which it has an unpleasant habit of doing lately,” a
second voice said.</p>

<p>“And do you think he’ll bring the money?”</p>

<p>“He’d better if he knows what’s good for him,”
was the answer. “He’s put me off long enough.”</p>

<p>“The old house by the cross-roads is the place,
ain’t it?” asked the party who had first spoken.</p>

<p>“That’s it, and if Noddy don’t show up he’ll
hear from me in a way he won’t like.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[97]</a></span></p>

<p>“Come on,” whispered Jerry to his chums.
“Let’s get out of this before those men see us.”</p>

<p>Quietly the three boys left the ice cream parlor.
They did not speak until they were in the street.</p>

<p>“What do you suppose they were talking
about?” asked Ned.</p>

<p>“I don’t know what the subject was,” replied
Jerry, “but I venture to say the person they meant
was our acquaintance, Noddy Nixon.”</p>

<p>“And he’s evidently expected to pay over some
money to-night,” added Bob.</p>

<p>“At the old house at the cross-roads,” put in
Ned. “I’ll bet I know where they mean.”</p>

<p>“Where?” asked Jerry.</p>

<p>“Don’t you remember that old tumbled-down
place we passed about three miles outside of this
town? Near the blacksmith shop?”</p>

<p>“You mean right after we crossed the river?”
inquired Jerry.</p>

<p>“That’s it.”</p>

<p>The same thought was in the minds of all three.
Bob was the first to mention it.</p>

<p>“Let’s go out there and see what we can learn,”
he said. “It is on our way home, and we have
plenty of time.”</p>

<p>“There may be some danger,” objected Jerry.</p>

<p>“Nonsense. We have as much right there as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[98]</a></span>
any one. All we have to do is to stop off from
our motor cycles as we pass. No one can object to
that.”</p>

<p>After some further conversation it was agreed
to do this. The boys wandered about the streets
a while longer and, as it was nearing eleven o’clock,
they thought they had better start. They found
their machines in proper order, and soon were moving
slowly out of town.</p>

<p>“There’s no use being in too much of a hurry,”
advised Bob. “Probably Noddy won’t meet the
men there much before midnight, and it lacks half
an hour of that now.”</p>

<p>A little later the three boys came in sight of the
deserted house. Lonesome and uncanny enough it
looked, the moonlight making mysterious shadows
here and there.</p>

<p>“Go easy,” spoke Ned. “No need to tell
them we are coming if by any chance they are
there.”</p>

<p>Silently the boys dismounted from their cycles,
leaned the machines up against the fence a short
way from in front of the house, and crept up
through the long grass that filled the yard of the
old vacant structure.</p>

<p>“Hold on!” cried Bob suddenly.</p>

<p>All three came to a halt.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[99]</a></span></p>

<p>“What is it?” whispered Jerry.</p>

<p>For answer Bob pointed toward a shed at the
side of the house. In it could be seen a light
gleaming.</p>

<p>“Are they in there?” asked Jerry.</p>

<p>“No, but some one’s motor-cycle is,” replied
Bob.</p>

<p>Foot by foot the three boys made toward the
dark and deserted house. They had circled half
way around it, and, coming to the rear, were suddenly
brought to a halt by a sliver of light shooting
out from some crack.</p>

<p>“Hold on!” exclaimed Bob.</p>

<p>They stopped and looked toward the light. It
came from the kitchen window, which was closed
by broken shutters through a splintered slat of
which the gleam came. On tip-toes the three boys
crept under the window. They peered into the
room, and the sight that met their eyes made them
start in surprise.</p>

<p>Seated around a rough table, on which stood a
lighted candle stuck in a bottle, were three figures.
One was Bill Berry, the other was a stranger and
the third was Noddy Nixon. The stranger was
holding a pistol to Noddy’s head, and seemed to be
threatening him.</p>

<p>Bill Berry was looking on, and taking no part in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[100]</a></span>
the proceedings, evidently. Then, as the boys
watched, they saw Noddy, plainly in fear of the
man with the weapon, pull from his pocket a roll
of bills.</p>

<p>He gave it to the stranger, fairly throwing it at
him in a rage. Then the man with the pistol, smiling
in a satisfied way, put up his weapon. Noddy
was saying something, for the boys could see his
lips moving, but they could not hear the words, for
the window was closed.</p>

<p>“Queer doings,” whispered Jerry.</p>

<p>At that instant Ned, in an endeavor to see better,
leaned a little forward. A piece of board he
was standing on broke with a loud crash, and he
toppled forward, hitting the window shutter with
his elbow.</p>

<p>Like a flash Noddy, Bill and the strange man
leaped to their feet and gazed in the direction of
the window.</p>

<p>“Quick! Light out of this!” exclaimed Bob.
“They will be after us in another minute!”</p>

<p>Sure enough, after a moment’s hesitation, Noddy
ran toward the door with the intention of going
outside and seeing who had made the racket.</p>

<p>“Hurry!” whispered Bob hoarsely. “To the
motor-cycles!”</p>

<p>The three boys lost no time. Hastening on in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[101]</a></span>
the darkness they stumbled and ran to where they
had left their machines.</p>

<p>As they reached them they heard a door opened,
and footsteps in hot pursuit.</p>

<p>“Who is it?” they heard Noddy’s voice inquiring.</p>

<p>The boys rolled their motor-cycles out in the
road. They leaped into the saddles, started off,
and in another instant had turned on the power
and were off down the highway leading to Cresville.
As they whizzed past the house, in which
several lights now gleamed, they heard Noddy cry:</p>

<p>“Confound them! I’ll fix them for spying on
me!”</p>

<p>At the same time they heard the explosions that
indicated that Noddy had put his motor cycle in
operation.</p>

<p>“The race is on!” cried Ned.</p>

<p>And a race it was to be. They were about thirty-five
miles from home. There was a good road,
and, with the moon high up now, it was well
lighted. The acetylene lamps on the machines
also gave good illumination. In a few minutes the
motors of the three boys were humming on half-speed.</p>

<p>Behind them, borne on the night wind, could be
heard the puffing of the motor-cycle in pursuit.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[102]</a></span>
But the three chums had a start of several minutes,
which counted much.</p>

<p>“Look behind and see if you can see his lamp,”
said Ned.</p>

<p>“Not a gleam,” reported Bob, after a hasty
glance.</p>

<p>Several miles were passed in this fashion, the
pursuing machine getting no nearer. Then, all at
once, Ned cried:</p>

<p>“I can see his light!”</p>

<p>It was true. Either Noddy had increased his
speed, or he had emerged from behind some bend
in the road that hitherto hid the gleam of his lamp
from the boys.</p>

<p>At the same time the explosions of his motor
sounded louder.</p>

<p>“He’s catching up to us!” cried Jerry. “Shall
we turn on more power?”</p>

<p>“It’s a little risky,” cautioned Bob. “Especially
as we don’t know the road very well. However,
another notch or two won’t do any harm.”</p>

<p>Noddy was now within an eighth of a mile.
His speed was increasing. Suddenly he called:</p>

<p>“Whoever you are, stop, or I’ll shoot!”</p>

<p>“He don’t know who we are, anyhow,” said
Jerry.</p>

<p>“I’m going to fire!” shouted Noddy.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[103]</a></span></p>

<p>“This is getting exciting!” cried Ned.</p>

<p>“He is only trying to scare us,” exclaimed Bob.</p>

<p>Then came a loud report.</p>

<p>“That wasn’t a revolver!” exclaimed Jerry.
“It sounded as if one of his tires burst. That’s
it!” he added a second later, as he looked back.
“Noddy has had an accident. I guess this race
is off!”</p>

<p>True enough, the front tire on Noddy’s machine
had collapsed. He was forced to stop, and, as
the boys sped on they could hear him faintly calling
after them. The three chums reduced the
speed of their motors, but did not stop, and soon
they were out of sight and hearing of Noddy.</p>

<p>“Well, we certainly had an adventure,” came
from Ned. “I wonder what it was all about?”</p>

<p>“We’ll find out some day,” was Jerry’s opinion.</p>

<p>Then, once more they took up their journey, and
reached Cresville without further happening, arriving
just before daylight.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XIII" id="CHAPTER_XIII">CHAPTER XIII.</a><br />
<small>ADVENTURES ON THE ROAD.</small></h2>


<p>“Want to take a ride with me?” asked Bob of
Ned, one morning, about a week following the exciting
night ride. “Father wants me to go over
to Franklin to take a message to the bank there.”</p>

<p>“Sure I’ll go. And we’ll ask Jerry. Wait until
I get my machine, and I’ll be with you.”</p>

<p>The two boys were soon puffing along their motors
to Jerry’s house. He joined them and all
three started off for Franklin.</p>

<p>The ride was a pleasant one. It was rather
warm, but there was a cool breeze, that was added
to by the speed at which the boys rode. Franklin
was about twenty miles from Cresville, and was a
village of good size. The boys had some friends
there, and intended calling on them before returning.</p>

<p>They reached Franklin without mishaps. Bob
transacted the business his father had sent him on,
and then the boys voted that a meal would not be
out of place.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[105]</a></span></p>

<p>“Well, I guess we’ll have to be starting back,”
said Bob at length. “Father will want to know
how I made out with his matter.”</p>

<p>Ned and Jerry were agreeable, and they mounted
their machines and were soon on the homeward
journey.</p>

<p>They had gone perhaps ten miles when, on making
a sudden turn in the road, they came face to
face with a countryman who was driving a rather
spirited horse. At the sight and sound of the
machines the animal reared up in the air. The
boys stopped their motors, but the horse would not
be quieted. Even the sight of the cycles seemed
to madden the brute. In spite of the efforts of the
countryman the horse continued to rear and prance.
Then the steed made a sudden turn, and, with a
cracking sound, one of the carriage shafts broke.</p>

<p>“Now ye’ve gone and done it!” yelled the
driver, seeming to fly in a rage. “Ye’ll have to
pay for this.”</p>

<p>“We’re very sorry,” began Jerry, “we didn’t
intend to cause any trouble.”</p>

<p>“That’s always the way with peesky boys,” went
on the countryman. “I’ll have the law on ye for
this! You wait until I get out.”</p>

<p>The horse, having done what damage he could,
seemed to be satisfied, and quieted down. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[106]</a></span>
driver dismounted and tied the animal to a fence,
and then proceeded to examine the broken shaft.</p>

<p>“Busted clean off,” he announced in an ugly
tone. “It’ll cost five dollars to get it fixed.
You’ll have to settle.”</p>

<p>“That’s right, make ’em pay!” exclaimed a
voice from the bushes that lined the road side, and,
to the surprise of the three boys, Noddy Nixon
stepped out into view.</p>

<p>“I intend to,” said the countryman.</p>

<p>“They’ve no business on the road in their machines,
frightening horses,” went on Noddy with a
grin. “The roads are for carriages.”</p>

<p>“Well, I like your nerve, Noddy Nixon!” exclaimed
Jerry hotly. “We have just as much
right on the road as this driver has. And you’ve
got a motor-cycle yourself.”</p>

<p>“That’s none of your business,” remarked Noddy
in a surly tone. “You cubs frightened this
man’s horse, and he has a right to demand payment.
Don’t let ’em get away until they pay,”
Noddy added to the driver.</p>

<p>“I don’t intend they shall,” was the answer.</p>

<p>“Look here!” exclaimed Bob. “We never
said we didn’t intend to pay, but it’s none of your
business, Noddy.”</p>

<p>“Don’t give me any of your lip,” the bully<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[107]</a></span>
roared. “I’ve been wanting to thrash you for
some time, and now I have a good chance.”</p>

<p>“Go ahead, if you think it’s healthy,” said Bob
boldly. “I’m not afraid of you.”</p>

<p>“If you fight him, you’ll have to fight me,” said
Jerry, coming forward and standing beside Bob.</p>

<p>“Yes, and me also,” said Ned.</p>

<p>“I guess I’ll have to take a hand then,” said the
countryman. “I want pay for my broken shaft.
If I can’t get it in money I’ll take it out of your
hides.”</p>

<p>“If you touch us I’ll make a complaint and
cause your arrest,” said Jerry.</p>

<p>“Who’s talking about arrests?” asked a gruff
voice, and, from the bushes whence Noddy had
made his appearance Bill Berry stepped out.</p>

<p>At the sight of him Noddy grinned, and moved
closer to Bob.</p>

<p>“That’s big talk for a small boy,” Bill went on
with a laugh. “What’s the row, Noddy?”</p>

<p>“Oh, these young cubs frightened this gentleman’s
horse, the animal broke a shaft, and they
won’t pay for it.”</p>

<p>“That isn’t true,” cried Bob. “We never refused
to pay for the damage.”</p>

<p>“Make ’em pay!” cried Bill, slapping his hand<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[108]</a></span>
on his thigh with a sound like a pistol shot.
“Make ’em pay!”</p>

<p>In a fit of passion Noddy aimed a blow at Bob.
The boy dodged it cleverly, and shot out his fist toward
Noddy’s face. He only landed lightly on
the bully’s nose, but that, with the overbalancing
caused when he missed his mark, sent Noddy down
in a heap.</p>

<p>“I’ll make you pay for this!” he fairly
screamed as he scrambled up.</p>

<p>He rushed at Bob. Ned and Jerry ran up and
were about to aid their chum.</p>

<p>“Let me attend to him alone!” pleaded Bob.</p>

<p>“I’ll fix you!” screamed the bully.</p>

<p>Once more he aimed a fearful blow at Bob, but
the latter merely stepped to one side, and once more
Noddy went down, without having been hit. He
arose with his mouth full of dust.</p>

<p>At that instant the countryman’s horse, probably
frightened by the noise and shouts, reared on its
hind legs, broke the strap that fastened him to the
fence, and galloped off down the road.</p>

<p>“Consarn ye! There goes my best horse!”
cried the countryman, losing all interest in the
fight. “Five dollars to whoever catches him!”</p>

<p>“I’m going to have a try for that!” exclaimed
Bill, setting off down the road on a swift run.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[109]</a></span>
“Five dollars don’t come my way every afternoon!”</p>

<p>“I’ll sue ye for this!” yelled the countryman,
shaking his fist at the boys before speeding down
the highway after Bill in pursuit of the horse.
“I’ll have the law on ye!” His coat tails
streamed in the wind as he raced away.</p>

<p>Noddy had stopped mid-way in his rush at Bob
as the horse broke loose.</p>

<p>“Well, are you going to fight?” asked Bob
coolly.</p>

<p>But Noddy’s desire for battle seemed to have
left him suddenly. He realized that he was no
match for the three, or even for two, of the boys.</p>

<p>“I’ll get square with you for this,” he muttered
as he slunk away in the bushes. “I’ve several
scores to settle with you three cubs.”</p>

<p>“Better settle ’em here and now,” advised Jerry.
“It’s a good chance.”</p>

<p>“You just wait,” was all Noddy would say.
Soon he disappeared in the shrubbery.</p>

<p>“Well, I thought for a while there was going
to be trouble,” said Bob, with a laugh. “Noddy
certainly seemed mad.”</p>

<p>“Well, I don’t see any need of staying here any
longer,” said Ned at length. “It doesn’t seem as
if the countryman or Bill would come back. If<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[110]</a></span>
that man with the horse wants any pay let him call
and collect. He didn’t treat us very nicely. As
for Noddy, I guess he’s far enough off by now.”</p>

<p>“I wonder what he was doing out this way?”
asked Bob.</p>

<p>“Yes, and lately Bill Berry is always with him,”
commented Ned.</p>

<p>“They’re up to no good, you can be sure of
that,” was Jerry’s opinion, in which the others
shared.</p>

<p>Then, mounting their motor-cycles, the three
boys made good speed home, meeting with no more
fractious horses and puncturing no more tires.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XIV" id="CHAPTER_XIV">CHAPTER XIV.</a><br />
<small>A FIRE AND A DISCOVERY.</small></h2>


<p>“Fire! Fire! Fire!”</p>

<p>Loud shouts of this dreadful alarm, mingled
with the ringing of bells, the tooting of whistles
and the hurrying of many feet awoke Jerry late
one night, three days after the encounter in the
road with the countryman and his skittish horse.</p>

<p>“Fire! Fire! Fire!” yelled men and boys
hastening down the street.</p>

<p>“Where’s the blaze?” asked Jerry, throwing
open his window and calling down to those running
past.</p>

<p>“Judson’s mill!” was the cry. “Looks like
a big fire!”</p>

<p>Jerry looked in the direction of the mill, and
saw a glare in the sky.</p>

<p>“I’m going!” he exclaimed.</p>

<p>“Oh Jerry, you might get hurt,” objected Mrs.
Hopkins.</p>

<p>“I’ll be careful, mother,” replied the boy, rapidly
dressing.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[112]</a></span></p>

<p>On his way to the blaze he met Ned, who had
also been awakened from his sleep by the alarm.
The two boys hurried toward the mill, to which
point it seemed as if every one in Cresville was
hastening. The glare in the sky grew brighter.</p>

<p>“Here comes one of the engines!” cried Ned,
as the apparatus dashed past. It was one of two
new steamers recently purchased.</p>

<p>“Hurry up, and let’s see it work!” called Jerry,
and the boys increased their run.</p>

<p>“How’d the mill catch fire?” panted Ned.</p>

<p>“I&mdash;didn’t&mdash;hear,” answered Jerry, breathing
hard.</p>

<p>In a little while they were at the scene of the
blaze. One of the smaller buildings of the mill
was burning furiously. Smoke, flames and sparks
were spouting from the roof, which was almost consumed.</p>

<p>Up dashed the engines. Connections were
quickly made to hydrants, and soon two good sized
streams were playing on the flames. The puffing
of the steamers, the snapping and crackle of the
flames, the shouts of those looking on, the yells
of the firemen and the crash as pieces of the burning
building fell in, made a din that was chaotic.</p>

<p>“Stand back boys!” exclaimed one of the firemen.
“We want to run a hose in that gate.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[113]</a></span></p>

<p>The boys made room and were now joined by
Bob.</p>

<p>“Can we go in?” asked Jerry. “We’ll keep
well back.”</p>

<p>The gate in front of which they stood gave
access to the mill yard, at a point quite a distance
from the fire.</p>

<p>“I guess it won’t do any harm,” answered the
fireman who was a good natured man. “But keep
well back in case the walls fall. We don’t want
any one to get hurt.”</p>

<p>“We’ll be careful,” promised Jerry, and the
boys followed the fire-fighter within the gate, helping
him drag the hose, which was twisting and
turning like a snake trying to get loose, so strong
was the water pressure.</p>

<p>At last the fury of the fire seemed to have
spent itself. The flames died down and all that
remained to do was to wet down the ruins thoroughly
to prevent any sparks from flying to other
departments of the mill. The blaze had been confined
to the building where it started, and, in spite
of the excitement over it, the damage had been
small.</p>

<p>“I’m glad it didn’t get into my office,” remarked
Mr. Judson, the mill owner, who had arrived
on the scene soon after the fire started.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[114]</a></span>
“All my valuable books and papers would have
been destroyed.”</p>

<p>“Yes, you got off pretty lucky,” said the chief.</p>

<p>“Thanks to the hard work you and your men
did,” Mr. Judson replied. “I won’t forget it, I
assure you.”</p>

<p>“We only did our duty,” responded the chief
modestly. “It’s our business to put out fires.”</p>

<p>There was not much more of interest to see, and
the three boys, as did a number of others, began
to think of going home.</p>

<p>Ned, Jerry and Bob started from the mill yard.
As they passed a pile of lumber near the gate Ned
gave one of the boards a careless kick. There was
a rattling sound and a small round object rolled
out at his feet.</p>

<p>“What’s that?” asked Jerry.</p>

<p>“Look’s like a tin can,” observed Bob.</p>

<p>Ned picked it up to examine it better, for it was
now quite dark, the fire giving only a faint glow.</p>

<p>“Look at this!” Ned cried, holding out the
object.</p>

<p>“It’s a burglar’s dark lantern!” exclaimed Bob.
“I saw one just like it that the police took from
a thief. It is over to police headquarters.”</p>

<p>“Wonder who put it there?” asked Jerry.</p>

<p>“It’s hard to&mdash;” began Ned, and then he stopped.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[115]</a></span>
Dropping to his knees he reached his hand
into the hole from whence the dark lantern had
rolled. He groped around a few seconds and then
drew out his hand.</p>

<p>“I’ve found ’em,” he said.</p>

<p>“What?” asked Jerry.</p>

<p>“The things I was looking for,” and Ned held
up to view in the faint gleam from the burned
building a cold chisel and a hammer.</p>

<p>“What are they for?” asked Bob, not seeing
the connection of the dark lantern and the tools
just found.</p>

<p>“These are the things the mill safe was robbed
with,” replied Ned. “The lantern made the light
that puzzled me that night I came past, and with
this cold chisel and hammer the lock was cut out.
The thief must have hidden the things under the
boards as he ran away with the money. It was on
his route as he passed out of the gate.”</p>

<p>“This mill robbery seems to follow us,” observed
Jerry. “Every once in a while something
about it crops out.”</p>

<p>“Yes,” commented Ned. “I saw the robbery
being committed, or rather I was there while it
was being done, we learned about the queer bank
bill and Noddy’s connection with it, and now we
have discovered the tools that were used.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[116]</a></span></p>

<p>“All we need to do next is to recover the
money,” said Bob.</p>

<p>“And find the thief,” said Ned.</p>

<p>“I fancy that won’t be difficult to do,” added
Bob. “If Noddy&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Hush!” exclaimed Ned, “some one is coming!
Let’s get out of here!”</p>

<p>Hurriedly Ned hid under his coat the lantern,
the hammer and chisel, and the three boys passed
out of the mill yard.</p>

<p>“What are you chaps doin’ here?” demanded
a rough voice, and Bill Berry shuffled up, looking
sharply at first one and then another.</p>

<p>“We were watching the fire,” replied Ned politely.
“Any objections, Mr. Berry?”</p>

<p>“You boys better keep away from here,”
growled Bill. “I reckon Mr. Judson don’t want
another robbery.”</p>

<p>“What do you mean?” demanded Jerry.
“Do you mean that we robbed the mill?”</p>

<p>“Well you might and then agin you mightn’t,”
mumbled Bill. “I ain’t sayin’ as how you did,
and I ain’t sayin’ as how you didn’t. You’d better
move on.”</p>

<p>“We’ve as much right here as you have, Bill
Berry,” said Bob. “We’re ready to go and we’re
going; all you may say wouldn’t move us, as long<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[117]</a></span>
as Mr. Judson didn’t object to our being here.”</p>

<p>“That’ll do for you,” muttered Bill, as he shuffled
away.</p>

<p>“Did you catch the horse and win the five dollars?”
inquired Jerry, referring to the countryman’s
fractious steed that ran away.</p>

<p>Bill’s only answer was a growl.</p>

<p>“Come on, let’s get home and go to bed,” suggested
Bob.</p>

<p>“Take good care of those tools,” warned Jerry.
Ned promised to do so; and there the talk came to
an end.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XV" id="CHAPTER_XV">CHAPTER XV.</a><br />
<small>NED UNDER SUSPICION.</small></h2>


<p>It was quite early in the morning some days
later when Bob called at Jerry’s house.</p>

<p>“Hello, Chunky!” greeted Jerry as he came to
the door, having finished a bountiful breakfast.
“What’s up now?”</p>

<p>“Thought maybe you might like to take a ride
off in the country,” replied the stout youth, panting
a bit from having to push his motor up the little
incline leading to his chum’s front door.</p>

<p>“Nothing would suit me better,” said the male
representative of the Hopkins family. “Where
is it to this time?”</p>

<p>“What do you say to a trip over to Limestone
Creek? We can go fishing.”</p>

<p>“I’m with you. Ned will go, of course?”</p>

<p>“Yes, he is waiting.”</p>

<p>Mrs. Slade, on Ned’s request, had the cook put
up a basket of bread and butter, some cake and
cheese, which Bob fastened to his machine. Then,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[119]</a></span>
the fishing tackle having been stowed away on
Jerry’s motor the three chums started off.</p>

<p>Limestone Creek was a stream about ten miles
from Cresville. It was a noted fishing place, and
many a fat chub or speckled trout had been pulled
from the sparkling waters. It was a hot August
day, but the boys did not mind the burning rays
of the sun. Part of the way they rode along
under big trees that gave a refreshing shade, and
occasionally there was a little breeze to cool them
off.</p>

<p>“Here we are,” cried Jerry at length as he
turned his machine from the main road, into a narrow
path that led through a green field to the
brook. “This way to the fishing banks!”</p>

<p>“Yes, and if you yell that way all the fish will
be scared away,” expostulated Ned. “Make a
little less noise if you want any luck.”</p>

<p>“Good idea,” chimed in Bob. He soon had
the lines in shape, and then, taking out his knife,
cut a slim willow pole that would serve excellently
for fishing. The others followed his example, and
soon all three were sitting on the grassy bank, while
the cork floats bobbed lightly in the swirl of the
eddy which formed the “old fishing hole.”</p>

<p>Luck was good with the young disciples of Isaak
Walton, and they soon had a dozen choice fish<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[120]</a></span>
among them. Then, as the sun was high in the
sky, and it was hot sitting on the bank, the boys
adjourned to the shade of the tree where they had
left their cycles.</p>

<p>“Now for dinner!” cried Bob.</p>

<p>“Let’s draw lots to see who makes the fire, who
cleans the fish and who cooks them,” suggested
Ned.</p>

<p>Ten minutes later an appetizing aroma filled the
summer air.</p>

<p>“Ah! Maybe that ain’t good!” cried Bob.</p>

<p>“Beats restaurants all to pieces!” was Ned’s
opinion.</p>

<p>Then with the bread and butter they had
brought along, with the seasoning for the fish, fresh
crullers and cheese, the whole washed down with
water from a clear cool spring near by, the boys
made a meal that even a king might have envied.</p>

<p>Dinner over they lolled lazily beneath the trees
until the sun was low in the west. Bob proposed
a walk along the creek as he wanted to see if there
were any evidences of musk-rats nests in a certain
place.</p>

<p>“Will it be safe to leave the machines here?”
asked Jerry. “Some one might come along and
ride off with them.”</p>

<p>“It would take more than one person to get<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[121]</a></span>
away with all three,” Bob said. “But we can
take out the spark plugs, and unless the thieves
have duplicates along they won’t get very far.”</p>

<p>Removing the plugs, the boys walked along the
stream for half a mile. They found no musk-rats
nests, and Bob, remarking that they could
come back another day and make a better search,
proposed a return trip.</p>

<p>It did not take long to reach the places where
they had left their machines. The spark plugs
were put back, and, after finishing what few crullers
remained, the three boys trundled their motors
out into the path.</p>

<p>“Here goes for home!” cried Ned, as he
vaulted into his saddle. He got his cycle started
by foot power and then attempted to throw the
power on. Nothing but a faint sound of air being
exhausted from the cylinders responded.</p>

<p>“Something’s wrong!” cried the boy.</p>

<p>At the same time the other two discovered that
their machines would not work. Again and again
they tried but with no result.</p>

<p>“Some one has cut the wires!” exclaimed Bob.
“You can see where they split the insulation,
shoved it to one side, broke the copper, and then
put the insulation back to cover up the mean
trick.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[122]</a></span></p>

<p>“You’re right!” exclaimed Ned. “I’d like to
catch the fellow who did it.”</p>

<p>Suddenly Jerry darted over toward the tree beneath
which the cycles had been standing. He
stooped down and picked up something which he
looked at closely.</p>

<p>“I fancy this will give us a clue,” he said, showing
a knife with an opened blade, to which there
clung some of the insulation from the copper wires.</p>

<p>“Whose is it?” asked Bob.</p>

<p>“It has the initials N. N. on it,” replied Jerry.</p>

<p>“And there’s only one person around here who
has a name with those letters,” put in Bob.</p>

<p>“There might be more,” said Jerry, inclined to
be cautious, “but I happen to remember that
Noddy Nixon had a knife like this. I saw him
use it once.”</p>

<p>“This is his first move in getting square, as he
would call it,” ventured Ned.</p>

<p>“Still it is only circumstantial evidence against
him,” reasoned Bob. “And we had better have
more before we accuse him.”</p>

<p>“Of course,” agreed Ned. “I think&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Which of you boys happens to be Ned
Slade?” interrupted a voice, and the boys turned
to see a short, stout fussy man gravely regarding
them.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[123]</a></span></p>

<p>“Ah, I thought so,” he remarked as Ned gave
an involuntary start. “Then you are the one I
want to see.”</p>

<p>“What for?” asked the owner of the name.</p>

<p>“Well&mdash;er&mdash;I don’t like to speak of it in
public.”</p>

<p>“I haven’t anything to conceal,” spoke Ned.</p>

<p>“Then if you haven’t I haven’t,” said the little
man. “I’m Sheriff Blackwell of Peterstown, and
I want to talk to you about a robbery.”</p>

<p>“What! Not the robbery of Mr. Judson’s
mill?” asked Ned, greatly excited. “Why I&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Now I may as well warn you right now, that
whatever you say will be used against you,” said
the sheriff. “Now that I’ve done my duty in
giving the warning, go ahead if you want to.”</p>

<p>“But you&mdash;you&mdash;why you surely don’t think
I robbed the mill?” asked Ned, flushing with
shame at the thought.</p>

<p>“Very good, but you can’t get anything out
of me, young man,” said the sheriff with a wise
nod. “I cut my eye teeth years ago. You’ll
have to come with me, at least for a while. I
reckon you can get bail.”</p>

<p>“Bail! Come with you! What do you
mean?” asked Ned, while his two chums stood
looking on, not knowing what to do.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[124]</a></span></p>

<p>“Look here,” began the fussy little sheriff.
“You were at the mill on the night of the robbery,
weren’t you?”</p>

<p>“I&mdash;er&mdash;that is I was&mdash;er&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Of course,” said the sheriff. “I knew you
were. And you never said anything about it when
we were hunting for clues, did you?”</p>

<p>“I told my two chums, Jerry and Bob, here,”
said Ned.</p>

<p>“That’s right,” chimed in Jerry, and Bob nodded
his head in assent.</p>

<p>“I’m acting on information and belief,” went
on the sheriff. “Certain knowledge has come to
me from a man who saw you at the mill on the
night of the robbery. It looks as if you might
know something about it, that is, who did it, and
who has the money. I might add that suspicion
points strongly to you.”</p>

<p>“To me?”</p>

<p>“Yes. Can you give us any clue that would
indicate that some one else might be involved?”</p>

<p>Ned hesitated an instant. He looked quickly
at Jerry, who shook his head slightly, to indicate
to Ned to have nothing to say about having seen
Noddy.</p>

<p>“I can’t give you any information,” said Ned
slowly.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[125]</a></span></p>

<p>“Then you’ll have to come with me,” went on
the sheriff.</p>

<p>“May I ask,” inquired Ned, “who told you
that I might be the guilty person?”</p>

<p>“A gentleman of Cresville, named William
Berry.”</p>

<p>“Bill Berry!” exclaimed Ned. “I&mdash;” and
then he stopped.</p>

<p>“I didn’t lose any time,” the representative of
the law continued. “I drove over from Peterstown
this morning. By judicious inquiries I
learned you and two other boys had come over
here. I followed. The law knows no delays.
Are you ready to come?”</p>

<p>“I have my motor cycle with me,” said Ned.
“Can I go on that?”</p>

<p>“If I let you ride your machine will you promise
to go slow, and not try to escape? I’ll drive
along in my carriage.”</p>

<p>“I’ll promise,” said Ned, the deep flush not
having left his face.</p>

<p>“Then we’ll consider that arranged. Come
on.”</p>

<p>Slowly, and in depressed spirits, greatly in contrast
to the gaiety with which they had arrived,
the three boys trundled their machines, the wires
of which had been quickly repaired, to the road.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[126]</a></span>
The sheriff untied his horse, got in the carriage,
and cautioning Ned to run his machine at reduced
speed, followed the boys who felt very little inclined
for talk. They were so worried that they
left their fish behind.</p>

<p>Eventually Cresville was reached. Ned, much
as he was humiliated by his technical arrest, knew
he could easily prove his innocence. But he felt
that the mystery of the mill robbery was deepening.</p>

<p>“I’ll go right to your house with you,” said the
sheriff to Ned. “We will have a talk with your
father, and I have no doubt we can come to some
understanding.”</p>

<p>Mr. Slade was surprised, incensed and puzzled
by turns when the fussy little sheriff in charge of
Ned called on him. The arm and majesty of the
law soon explained what had taken place.</p>

<p>“This Mr. Berry is sure he saw your son at the
mill,” repeated the sheriff.</p>

<p>“I wouldn’t depend too much on Berry’s word,”
said the merchant.</p>

<p>“I was at the mill that night,” exclaimed Ned.
Then he related what he had seen, all about the
queer light, the presence of Bill Berry, and the
finding of the tools and dark lantern. He only refrained
from mentioning Noddy’s name, since he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[127]</a></span>
did not feel justified in bringing him in, no matter
what his suspicions were concerning the bully.</p>

<p>“Great Snakes and little fishes!” exclaimed the
sheriff, when Ned had finished. “I wish I had
known this at the time. I guess we’ll have to hold
you, as a witness, at least, my boy.”</p>

<p>But Ned’s father had sufficient standing in the
town to render unnecessary any formal proceedings
in holding Ned, and the sheriff departed without
his one-time prisoner, on Ned’s promise to give
evidence when wanted.</p>

<small>PLANS FOR A MOTOR-CYCLE RACE.</small></h2>


<p>“Well, Ned,” said Mr. Slade when the sheriff
had gone, “you came close to getting into trouble.
Why didn’t you mention to me something about
seeing the light in the mill.”</p>

<p>“I thought of it,” replied the boy, “but after
I talked it over with Bob and Jerry we decided it
was better not to say anything about it. Besides,
I haven’t told all yet.”</p>

<p>“What? Is there more to tell?”</p>

<p>“Yes. I saw some one besides Bill Berry at the
mill that night.”</p>

<p>“Who?”</p>

<p>“Noddy Nixon,” and then Ned told of meeting
Noddy with the box of bait, as the bully had called
it. He also related what the three boys had
planned to do in keeping watch of Noddy, and of
the odd bank bill.</p>

<p>“I think it would have been wise to tell some
older person of all this,” commented Mr. Slade.
“Still I appreciate that you did not want to cast<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[129]</a></span>
suspicion on any one. And, as you say, it is only
a vague suspicion as yet. Noddy may be as innocent
as you. I would like to know more of this
Bill Berry.”</p>

<p>“He knows who robbed the mill,” said Ned.</p>

<p>“What makes you think so?”</p>

<p>“Because he was looking right in the office door
when the light was visible.”</p>

<p>“If he knew why should he cast suspicion on
you?”</p>

<p>“I don’t know, unless it is to draw attention
from some one else.”</p>

<p>“You mean Noddy?”</p>

<p>Ned nodded his head affirmatively.</p>

<p>“Think no more about it; at least for the present,”
advised Mr. Slade. “I will see to the legal
end of it, and take care you are not again annoyed
by the sheriff unless it is necessary to give evidence.
I would urge you and your two chums to
keep quiet about this.”</p>

<p>The boy promised, and both Bob and Jerry
agreed to say nothing of the latest development in
the mill robbery mystery when Ned had told them
of the outcome of the sheriff’s act.</p>

<p>For several days after this it was so hot that
the boys stayed quietly at home instead of taking
trips on their machines. Toward the end of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[130]</a></span>
week, however, there came several heavy thunder
showers that cooled the air, laid the dust, and
made traveling pleasant. It was on Saturday afternoon
that the three chums went for another
short spin.</p>

<p>Coming back they stopped at the Athletic club
house. Leaving their wheels in charge of the caretaker
they went to the refreshment room to have
some soda and ice cream.</p>

<p>“I say, what’s this?” exclaimed Ned, catching
sight of a large notice fastened on the wall.
“Come here Chunky and Jerry. This looks as if
it was meant for us.”</p>

<p>Rapidly the three boys read an announcement
that the Cresville club had decided to hold a grand
motor cycle meet, open to competitors of all
classes and all makes of machines, not over two
cylinders in size. There were to be three prizes.
The first was to be optional with the winner and of
the value of two thousand dollars, the second one
thousand dollars and the third five hundred dollars.
Articles worth these amounts would be
given, it was stated, and entries would be received
until within a week of the race, which was to be on
September 20.</p>

<p>“What do you think of that, Chunky?” asked
Ned.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[131]</a></span></p>

<p>“It seems to hit us in the right spot,” replied
the heavy-weight youth. “I’m going to enter.”</p>

<p>“So am I,” came from Ned and Jerry in a
chorus.</p>

<p>“Wouldn’t it be great if one of us could win the
first prize?” inquired Jerry. “Think of getting
something worth two thousand dollars.”</p>

<p>“I wonder what I’d take if I won?” asked Bob
of no one in particular.</p>

<p>“I think we have as good a chance of winning
as any one,” proceeded Jerry.</p>

<p>“I don’t doubt it,” agreed Ned.</p>

<p>“Then let’s agree,” and Jerry’s face was serious,
“that if any of us captures that first prize we’ll
select an automobile touring car.”</p>

<p>“An automobile?” exclaimed Ned.</p>

<p>“A touring car?” cried Bob.</p>

<p>“Certainly. Why not? Isn’t that better than
a horse, or a motor boat? Think what it would
mean. We could travel all over,&mdash;make a tour
of the United States perhaps. Yes, sir, that’s the
ticket! If we win let’s get a touring car. What
do you say, boys?”</p>

<p>For a few seconds the very audacity of the idea
seemed to stagger Ned and Bob. They gradually
recovered, and their eyes shone as they realized the
possibilities of the plan.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[132]</a></span></p>

<p>“We’ll do it!” exclaimed Ned.</p>

<p>“That’s what we will!” asserted Bob.</p>

<p>“Then all we have to do is to go in and win
that first prize,” concluded Jerry. “We must begin
practice at once.”</p>

<p>“And there isn’t the least doubt but what you’ll
win,” exclaimed a mocking voice suddenly.</p>

<p>The boys turned, to behold Noddy Nixon grinning
at them.</p>

<p>“Not the least in the world,” went on the bully
in tantalizing tones. “In fact I don’t see why
they hold any contest at all. The club might as
well give you boys all three prizes. It would
save a lot of work.”</p>

<p>“Look here&mdash;,” began Bob, but Ned placed a
quieting hand on his shoulder.</p>

<p>“Don’t reply to him,” said Ned. “It may
make trouble.”</p>

<p>“You think because you won a little race a while
ago that you can go in a big one,” went on Noddy.
“But you’ll find that this is a different matter.”</p>

<p>“I suppose you’re going to enter?” asked
Jerry.</p>

<p>“Is it any of your business if I do?” inquired
Noddy.</p>

<p>“None at all,” replied Jerry. “Only if you do
decide to start in the races you might find this<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[133]</a></span>
handy, in case you had to cut any wires, you know,”
and he handed Noddy the knife with the initials
N. N. that the boys had found the day their cycles
were disabled in the field.</p>

<p>“What’s that?” asked Noddy, not seeing at
first what it was that Jerry held toward him.</p>

<p>“It’s a knife that I think belongs to you,” said
Jerry. “It has been used to cut wires with,” he
went on, “and it may come in handy for that purpose
again.”</p>

<p>“I don’t know what you mean,” Noddy responded,
but a deep blush dyed his face and he
looked very uncomfortable.</p>

<p>“Then you don’t care to claim this?” asked
Jerry as he saw Noddy turn aside.</p>

<p>“It isn’t mine; why should I?” Noddy asked
in turn, though the boys knew he was telling an untruth.</p>

<p>“Very well,” Jerry said, replacing the knife in
his pocket as Noddy hurried from the room.</p>

<p>“He’s a cool one,” commented Ned.</p>

<p>“That’s what he is,” assented Bob. “If he
only knew all we know he would act differently.”</p>

<p>“But it’s not time to say anything yet,” counseled
Jerry. “We must go slow.”</p>

<p>The boys resumed their talk about the coming
motor cycle races. They discussed the questions<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[134]</a></span>
from all sides, and decided that, accidents excepted,
they had at any rate as good a chance of
winning, at least one of the prizes, as any one else.</p>

<p>“We’ll form a community of interests,” said
Bob. “We’ll race separately, but whoever wins
pledges himself to get a touring automobile, if one
can be had for the amount of the prize, and share
it with the others. Is that a go?”</p>

<p>“It is,” said Jerry.</p>

<p>“Every time, as far as I am concerned,” was
Ned’s answer.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XVII" id="CHAPTER_XVII">CHAPTER XVII.</a><br />
<small>CAUGHT IN THE STORM.</small></h2>


<p>“We ought to begin our training for the motor cycle
race soon,” said Jerry one morning, when he
stopped at Ned’s house, coming back from the
post-office.</p>

<p>“I guess you’re right,” Ned assented. “I
think a few good long trips on the road as a starter
would be a fine thing. What we need most is an
endurance run, for that’s what will count in the
twenty-five mile race that we are going to compete
in.”</p>

<p>“I was thinking of that myself,” Jerry remarked.
“What would you say to a pretty long
trip, say one hundred miles? We could run to
Huntsville, which is about sixty miles from here as
I figure it, stay there all night, and come back the
next day. That would give us good practice.”</p>

<p>“Sounds as if it might do,” was Ned’s opinion.
“Let’s go over and talk to Bob about it.”</p>

<p>Eight o’clock the next morning saw them assembled
in Bob’s yard, for it had been agreed to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[136]</a></span>
start from his house. The last touches were given
the machines and, at a signal from Jerry, the trip
was begun.</p>

<p>“Where are we going to stop for dinner?”
asked Bob, when they had been riding about an
hour.</p>

<p>“There he goes,” said Jerry in a pretended
complaining voice. “I never did see such a fellow!
You’d think he was all stomach.”</p>

<p>“Why,” began Ned soberly, “Jerry and I had
about made up our minds that we’d go without dinner.
It will be good training and you need it you
know, Chunky.”</p>

<p>“Oh!” groaned the stout youth. “Oh dear!
If I had known that I wouldn’t have come along.
I can’t go without my dinner.”</p>

<p>There was silence for a little while, broken now
and again by a deep sigh from Bob. Jerry and
Ned had all they could do to keep from laughing,
but they managed to keep their faces serious.</p>

<p>“Let’s speed up a bit,” suggested the stout boy,
after a time.</p>

<p>“What for?” asked Ned.</p>

<p>“Dinner time will come and pass quicker then,”
explained the hungry one. “Maybe we won’t
notice it at all. But I surely will be glad when
supper time comes.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[137]</a></span></p>

<p>“No, we agreed to run slowly,” Jerry remarked,
“and we must stick to our plan.”</p>

<p>Bob sighed but said nothing. On and on they
rode, along pleasant highways, under big shady
trees, up hill and down dale. At last, when the
sun was almost at the zenith, they came to the top
of a hill that led down into a pretty valley.</p>

<p>In the centre of the vale, which was surrounded
on all sides by green wooded hills, nestled a village.</p>

<p>“That’s the town of Montville,” said Jerry.
“We are half way to Huntsville now.”</p>

<p>“Are we going to stop here?” asked Bob, a
note of hope coming into his voice.</p>

<p>“What for?” inquired Ned, winking at Jerry.</p>

<p>“I&mdash;er&mdash;thought&mdash;er&mdash;we&mdash;” began
Bob.</p>

<p>“Own up! It was dinner you were thinking
of, now wasn’t it Chunky?”</p>

<p>“Yes, it was,” admitted Bob in desperation.</p>

<p>Jerry and Ned laughed outright.</p>

<p>“I don’t see anything so very funny,” exclaimed
Bob, who was not in the best of humor. “If you
had the appetite I have you wouldn’t want to
laugh.”</p>

<p>By this time the boys had reached the village
and were riding through the streets. People<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[138]</a></span>
turned to stare at them, but the chums were used
to that by this time. They steered past a hotel.</p>

<p>“Ah! Um! Doesn’t that smell good!” cried
Ned, tilting his nose high in the air and sniffing
vigorously. “I’ll bet they have ham and eggs!”</p>

<p>“Just what I was wishing for,” groaned Bob.
“I’m going to have my dinner, training or no
training, race or no race,” and, with a determined
look he got off his machine.</p>

<p>“Ha! Ha! Ha!” laughed Bob’s two chums.</p>

<p>“I wondered how much longer we could keep
up the joke,” Jerry said, when he had ceased
chuckling. “You were easy, Chunky.”</p>

<p>“Then we are going to have dinner?” asked
Bob, all his ill humor gone.</p>

<p>“That’s just what we are, Chunky, my boy!”
exclaimed Jerry. “We were only fooling you.”</p>

<p>They all sat down to a bountifully spread table
a little later, and Ned and Jerry were almost sorry
for the anguish they had caused their chum, when
they saw, by the quantity of ham and eggs he
consumed, how really hungry he had been.</p>

<p>Dinner over, the three boys sat about on the
hotel piazza for an hour. They were plied with
questions as to the working of their machines by
about a score of boys and youths who had gathered
to see the motors operated, Jerry kindly went<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[139]</a></span>
into details and entertained the little audience for
some time.</p>

<p>“Well, I think we’d better be going,” said
Jerry to his chums at length. “It’s two o’clock
and we can just about reach Huntsville by night.”</p>

<p>“You’re goin’ t’ git ketched in a storm,” said
the hotel keeper.</p>

<p>“Think so?” inquired Jerry.</p>

<p>“I know it.” The man pointed to where a
bank of dark clouds were accumulating in the west.
“Thunder storm coming as sure as guns is guns.”</p>

<p>“Well, we’ll ride on, and if we have to take to
shelter I guess we can find it,” Jerry said. “We
don’t mind a little rain. We’re out for practice.”</p>

<p>“Well, good luck to ye,” called the hotel man
after the three boys, as they rode down the village
street. “Stop in agin when ye’re in this direction.”</p>

<p>For a time it seemed as if the prediction of the
storm was not going to be verified. The bank of
clouds grew no larger, and the sun still shone.
The boys speeded up a bit as they struck a stretch
of good road.</p>

<p>“Hark! What was that?” asked Ned.</p>

<p>“Sounded like thunder,” replied Jerry.</p>

<p>There was no doubt of it a minute later, for the
distant rumble of the sky-artillery could easily be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[140]</a></span>
distinguished. The wind, which had died away,
began to blow stronger, and the clouds spread over
the heavens and were blacker.</p>

<p>“It won’t break for half an hour,” was Ned’s
opinion. “We can ride on through a little rain,
but if it gets too bad we can turn into some barn.”</p>

<p>In less than fifteen minutes the first drops
splashed down. The rumble of thunder grew
louder, and there were vivid spurts and tongues of
lightning leaping across the black vapor masses.</p>

<p>Crack! sounded a report so loud that it seemed
as if lightning had struck near by. For a moment
there was no apparent increase in the fury of
the storm. Then came a flash so bright that it
seemed as if the whole heavens had been lighted
up. It was followed by a terrifying crash that
fairly shook the earth, and then came a deluge of
water that almost hid the three boys one from another
as it poured down from the clouds.</p>

<p>“We’d better get out of this!” cried Jerry.
“It seems to be getting worse. Put on full speed!
I saw a house a little way ahead. We’ll stop there
until this is over!”</p>

<p>Ned and Bob could just hear Jerry through the
noise the storm made, though the boy was shouting
at the top of his voice.</p>

<p>The storm was at its height now. The lightning<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[141]</a></span>
seemed incessant, and the thunder claps followed
one after the other so closely that it was a
continual roar. The wind was a regular gale,
driving the rain with stinging force into the faces
of the riders.</p>

<p>“Here we are!” yelled Jerry presently.
“Turn in!”</p>

<p>Dimly through the rain Ned and Bob could see
their chum steering through a drive-way alongside
of a white house on the left of the highway. They
followed him, and soon found themselves in front
of a barn, to which the drive-way led.</p>

<p>“Hurry up inside!” Jerry called. “And bring
the machines in with you!”</p>

<p>The motors were stopped and three drenched
boys trundled them into the shelter of the barn,
the doors of which Jerry had found unlocked, and
had managed to open.</p>

<p>“Whew! This is a storm!” exclaimed Ned,
wiping the water from his eyes.</p>

<p>“Storm! I should say so&mdash;terrible&mdash;fearful!
Worst one in twenty-one years! Hundreds
of people struck! Houses burned! Barns blown
over! Awful! Awful! Hello! Bob, Ned
and Jerry! Where’d you come from? Glad to
see you&mdash;come in&mdash;shut the door&mdash;get up in
the hay and dry off&mdash;this is the worst ever!” and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[142]</a></span>
then the voice, that had uttered all this in one
breath stopped, and the three chums who had
started in surprise as the torrent of words began,
turned to behold their friend Andy Rush.</p>

<p>“Well, how in the world did you get here?”
asked Jerry, taking off his cap and wringing the
water from it.</p>

<p>“On a visit&mdash;my Aunt Jane lives here&mdash;nice
lady&mdash;she’ll be glad to see you&mdash;lots to eat&mdash;I’m
having a fine time&mdash;came out here to feed
the horse&mdash;storm came up&mdash;I didn’t want to
get wet&mdash;say how’d you get here?”</p>

<p>“The same old Andy,” murmured Ned to Bob.
“He’ll beat the storm for wind.”</p>

<p>“We were going to Huntsville on our motors,”
Jerry explained, “and we got caught in the deluge.
Do you suppose your aunt will mind if we
stay here a while?”</p>

<p>“Not a bit&mdash;glad to have you&mdash;Whoop!
That was a cracker&mdash;bet it struck the house!”
cried Andy, as a louder clap of thunder than usual
fairly shook the barn.</p>

<p>Andy ran to the door and peered through a
crack in the direction of the house.</p>

<p>“Nope, it’s all right,” he called, in a sort of
disappointed tone. “No damage done&mdash;but say&mdash;I’m
glad you happened to strike this place&mdash;how’s<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[143]</a></span>
things in Cresville? I’ve been here a week&mdash;fishing&mdash;riding
horses&mdash;milking cows&mdash;lots
of fun&mdash;can’t you stay a few days&mdash;I know a
dandy place to fish&mdash;catch big suckers&mdash;chub&mdash;Aunt
Jane will give you lots to eat&mdash;whoop!”</p>

<p>Andy could not seem to keep still. He hurried
around in the barn, and, to give vent to his feelings
he crawled up on a high beam, and jumped down
in a big pile of hay.</p>

<p>The three chums were laughing so they could
hardly speak. When they ceased Jerry thanked
Andy for the invitation, but said they had made
other plans.</p>

<p>“But you can stay all night,” suggested Andy,
calming down a bit. “The roads will be bad
after this storm. You can go to Huntsville in the
morning. It’s only ten miles from here.”</p>

<p>The idea appealed to the boys. The storm
showed no signs of stopping, and they knew it
would be impossible to go on while it lasted. As
Andy had said, they could proceed in the morning,
and there was no special need of reaching Huntsville
anyhow, except that they wanted to carry out
the arrangements they had made, and make a trip
of over a hundred miles.</p>

<p>The evening was pleasantly spent in talking,
singing and playing games. Andy’s uncle wanted<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[144]</a></span>
the three chums to remain over a day or two, but,
though they thanked him for the invitation they
decided to push on the next morning, complete
their scheduled trip, and then return home.</p>

<hr class="chap" />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[145]</a></span></p>




<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XVIII" id="CHAPTER_XVIII">CHAPTER XVIII.</a><br />
<small>A LEAP FOR LIFE.</small></h2>


<p>“Hurrah!” cried Andy the next morning,
bursting into the room where the three chums had
slept. “Hurrah! It’s a fine day! Rain all
stopped&mdash;sun shines&mdash;sorry to see you fellows
go&mdash;come again!”</p>

<p>“Take it easy,” advised Jerry. “We’re very
much obliged to you, Andy, for providing this
fine shelter for us. Wish you were going along.”</p>

<p>“So do I&mdash;can’t though&mdash;got to stay here
another week&mdash;help run the farm&mdash;maybe I’ll
be a farmer some day&mdash;whoop!”</p>

<p>In spite of the storm, which had been an unusually
severe one, the roads were in fairly good
shape. Now and then a stretch would be reached
where speed had to be slackened but, by picking
their way, the machines were pushed along at a
good rate. Huntsville was reached in about two
hours, and the boys left their machines in charge of
a store keeper while they walked about the town
viewing the sights.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[146]</a></span></p>

<p>There was not much to be seen, and they had
come more for the sake of saying they had ridden
the distance than from any other reason.
Purchasing a few souvenirs for the folks at home,
and buying some sandwiches in case they might not
find a convenient eating place, the boys prepared
for the return trip.</p>

<p>“We’ll take a little different way on our back
trip,” said Jerry. “I know a road that goes past
a fine waterfall that’s worth seeing.”</p>

<p>The falls were about fifty feet high, and, with
the jagged rocks over which the water flowed, and
the trees on either side, made a picture well worth
beholding.</p>

<p>The boys stopped for half an hour, watching the
leaping, falling water, which possessed a peculiar
fascination. Then, as they still had most of their
trip before them, Jerry suggested they had better
start.</p>

<p>They had not yet turned into the road leading
to Cresville, from which they had diverged in
order to visit the falls, when riding along a rather
lonely stretch of the highway, the boys came in
sight of a white house, with no other residences
near it. As they came opposite a man suddenly
ran from the front door. He seemed greatly excited.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[147]</a></span></p>

<p>“Stop!” he called to the boys. “Stop, for
Heaven’s sake.”</p>

<p>There was so much anguish in his tone that the
boys knew something must have happened.</p>

<p>“What is it?” asked Jerry, riding up to the
front gate and dismounting.</p>

<p>“It’s my wife! She has just been taken very
sick and I’m all alone here. I need a doctor, but
I dare not leave her to get one, and I have no
one to send. I saw you coming down the road
and I thought maybe you would help me!”</p>

<p>“Of course we will,” replied Jerry heartily.
“Where does the doctor live? I’ll ride after
him.”</p>

<p>“His house is about two miles from here,” said
the man. “It’s the first one after you cross the
white bridge. Oh! Hurry, and tell him to be
quick! I’m afraid my wife is dying! Tell him
to come to Mr. Johnson’s! Oh! What shall I
do!” and the unfortunate man showed so much
distress that the hearts of the boys were touched.</p>

<p>“Don’t worry,” Jerry advised. “I’ll make
good time. Ned and Bob will stay with you.
Maybe they will be of some help.”</p>

<p>Springing into the saddle, Jerry started his machine
and soon had it going at a good rate. Because
of the condition of the roads, which were not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[148]</a></span>
in the best of shape, he dared not push the motor
to the limit. Ned and Bob followed the man into
the house, willing to do what they could.</p>

<p>Meanwhile Jerry rode on. A turn of the road
soon hid the lonely farm house from sight. The
grade was up hill for a way, and the machine did
not make such good time.</p>

<p>“I must hurry,” reasoned the boy. “I hope
I find the doctor at home.”</p>

<p>In a few minutes Jerry had come to the top of
the hill. At the foot of the slope, which was
about half a mile in extent, the boy saw a white
bridge, that spanned a narrow but swift running
stream.</p>

<p>“Here goes!” cried Jerry. He was about to
coast at half speed down the hill when a voice suddenly
called:</p>

<p>“Stop!”</p>

<p>“I can’t!” shouted back Jerry. “I’m hurrying
for the doctor!”</p>

<p>The boy turned to see who had warned him,
and saw a farmer hurrying across the field toward
him. Something in his manner caused Jerry to
dismount.</p>

<p>“You can’t get across the bridge!” cried the
man. “It’s broken. If you ride down that hill
you’ll be killed! I stopped you just in time!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[149]</a></span></p>

<p>Jerry felt his heart sink.</p>

<p>“The rains made the creek rise,” explained the
man. “The farther span of the bridge was carried
away last night. There’s a sign just this side
of it warning people, but if you rode down on that
lickity-split thing I knew you’d never see the sign
until it was too late.”</p>

<p>“I’m much obliged to you,” said Jerry. “But
I must cross that stream. A lady back there,”
pointing in the direction he had come, “is dying.
I’m after the doctor.”</p>

<p>“That’s bad,” said the man. “But I don’t see
how you’re going to do it.”</p>

<p>“Is the missing span of the bridge too wide for
me to jump across?” asked Jerry, a sudden idea
coming into his head.</p>

<p>“It’s fifteen feet,” replied the man. “That’s
too much for you I reckon. And if you didn’t
make it you’d be killed, for the current is very
swift, and the creek is full of rocks.”</p>

<p>“Can’t we get planks and bridge the gap?”
asked the boy in desperation. “Something must
be done.”</p>

<p>“I’m on my way to get men to mend the break
now,” the man said. “But it will take some
time.”</p>

<p>“Isn’t there another bridge near here?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[150]</a></span></p>

<p>“Not one within five miles either way,” was the
answer. “I’m very sorry, my boy. Is the sick
woman any relation of yours?”</p>

<p>“No, her husband stopped me as I was riding
past the house with my two chums, and begged us
to hurry after a doctor.”</p>

<p>“Well, I’ll go after some planks,” said the
man, “but it may take two hours to get ’em here.
I’ll have to hunt for ’em.”</p>

<p>Slowly Jerry rode his motor down to the white
structure that spanned the now swollen and swiftly
running stream. As the man had said the last
span of the bridge, on the side farthest from
Jerry, had been carried away. It was the part
which had extended from the shore to the stone
abutment.</p>

<p>The boy carefully examined the ruined bridge.
There were planks on the floor, but they were
firmly spiked down, and none of them seemed long
enough. To leap the gap was a feat beyond Jerry’s
ability, though a professional jumper might
have done it.</p>

<p>“If the stream wasn’t so swift I could swim it,”
the boy murmured. “But it’s too risky. Besides,
even if I get over, I wonder how the doctor is
to come back? Though I guess I can manage
that. He can bring some planks with him, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[151]</a></span>
walk over on them. That part will be all right if
I can only get across.”</p>

<p>But Jerry had to admit that the problem was a
difficult one to solve. He looked at the bridge
with sorrow in his heart as he thought of the man
waiting anxiously for the doctor.</p>

<p>“I simply must get across!” exclaimed the boy.</p>

<p>As he walked to the edge of the structure, looking
in vain for a plank that would serve, Jerry noticed
a strange trick that the water had played. In
tearing away the far span the timbers that remained
resting on the stone abutment had been
loosened. This caused the middle of what was
left of the bridge to sag, or dip down to considerable
degree.</p>

<p>All at once a daring thought came to Jerry. He
looked at the sagging bridge, at the gap where
the span was missing, and at the angry waters that
swirled between him and the other shore. Then
he turned and looked back at the hill which came
to an end right at the bridge.</p>

<p>“I have it!” cried the boy, his eyes shining
with excitement. “If I only dare do it! I will
do it!”</p>

<p>He hurried back to where he had left his motor cycle.
He started it in motion and rode slowly
back up the hill which he had just descended.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[152]</a></span>
Any one seeing him, and not knowing his plan
might have thought he had given up in despair.
But Jerry was not that kind of a boy.</p>

<p>When he looked at the broken and sagging
bridge he had suddenly thought of a trick he had
seen performed in a circus that had exhibited in
Cresville. This was where a man on a bicycle
had started down a steep incline of boards to accomplish
what was billed as “A Leap For Life!”
The incline was broken about three-quarters of the
way down, making a gap. Just before the gap
was reached there was a dip, or curve in the incline.
Across the gap the incline was continued at
a slight angle.</p>

<p>The principle on which the feat was performed
was, that the man on the bicycle, rushing down the
incline, would get momentum enough to shoot
across the gap. To prevent the wheel and rider
from falling from the attraction of gravitation
while it was flying across the space, the end of the
incline was curved upward. This served to shoot
the machine and man into the air, and overcame,
for the time necessary to speed across the gap, the
pull of the earth.</p>

<p>And, in a crude way, Jerry saw before him all
the elements that went to make up the trick as it
is performed in many circuses.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[153]</a></span></p>

<p>The hill made the incline. The sag in the middle
of the bridge, and the little rise at the further
abutment, gave the necessary upward curve that
would throw Jerry and his motor far enough into
the air to prevent him tumbling into the stream.
The missing span was the gap corresponding to
the one in the inclined plane of boards, and the
road on the farther shore would make a good
landing place.</p>

<p>“I guess I can do it as well as that man in the
circus!” exclaimed Jerry. “It’s a risk, I know,
but I can’t stay here and wait two hours for that
man to bring the planks.”</p>

<p>He was soon at the top of the hill. He looked
around to see if any one was in sight to aid him
in case he failed. But the roads were deserted.</p>

<p>“I must put on full speed,” thought the boy.
“I’ll need all the momentum I can get.”</p>

<p>He turned his machine to face down the slope.
For a moment he hesitated as he looked at what
was before him. But, steeling his heart, and uttering
a short prayer, he leaped into the saddle.</p>

<p>“Here I go!” thought Jerry. He turned the
motor to full speed, and soon was racing down the
hill at a fearful pace. “There’s no stopping
now!” he murmured.</p>

<p>How the wind sang in his ears! The motor<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[154]</a></span>
fairly hummed beneath him, and the big tires threw
up a shower of mud. On and on rushed the boy!
Nearer and nearer he came to the broken bridge.
He heard a shout behind him but he dared not turn
to see who it was.</p>

<p>He was twenty feet from the spot where the
road ended and the bridge began. He wanted to
shut his eyes, but he knew he must guide the motor
with a firm and steady hand. He gripped the
steering bars with all his might. There was a
whizz as the rubber tires struck the wooden planking
of the bridge. Jerry felt himself going down
as he reached the sagging middle of the broken
structure.</p>

<p>Then, like a stone fired from some ancient catapult,
<a href="#image03">he felt his machine rise under him</a>, shoot up
into the air, and sail across the gap.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 600px;">

     title="HE FELT HIS MACHINE RISE UNDER HIM." /></a><br />
<div class="caption"><a href="#Page_154">HE FELT HIS MACHINE RISE UNDER HIM.</a></div>
</div>

<p>For one instant Jerry looked down at the black
swirling waters below him. Then with a terrific
thud he felt himself land on the road across the
missing span.</p>

<p>He had made the leap for life and succeeded!</p>

<p>So swiftly was the machine going that even the
shock of the landing in the road beyond the broken
bridge did not check it. On and on it rushed
until Jerry, whose breath had been almost shaken
from him by the concussion, turned off the power.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[155]</a></span></p>

<p>“But I must not stop!” cried the boy. “I’m
safely across, and I’ve got to get the doctor!”</p>

<p>So turning on the power again he sent the motor
flying down the road. Three-quarters of a mile
further he came to the first house. There was a
sign on it:</p>

<p class="noic"><span class="smcap">Dr. John Rand.</span><br /></p>

<p>“Is the doctor in?” gasped Jerry, barely able to
stand as he leaped from his machine and rang the
bell which was answered by a woman.</p>

<p>“Yes, right in his office,” was the answer.</p>

<p>“Tell him he’s wanted at once! Mrs. Johnson
is dying!”</p>

<p>“But I can’t get across the bridge; it is broken,”
said Dr. Rand, who had come from his office in
time to hear Jerry’s message.</p>

<p>“I got across,” exclaimed the boy. “Quick,
doctor! You must hurry! Take a long plank
along and you can get over the gap!”</p>

<p>“But if I did get across, how am I to get my
horse over? He can’t walk a plank,” objected the
medicine man. “It will take a long time for me
to walk to Mrs. Johnson’s.”</p>

<p>Once more it looked as if Jerry had failed.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XIX" id="CHAPTER_XIX">CHAPTER XIX.</a><br />
<small>JERRY AND THE DOCTOR.</small></h2>


<p>“I don’t see how I can get there in time to be
of any service,” Dr. Rand went on. “I’ll start
and walk of course.”</p>

<p>“I have a better plan!” cried Jerry suddenly.
“Hitch up your horse, and bring two planks
along.”</p>

<p>“But, my boy, you can’t get a horse and carriage
across on two narrow planks.”</p>

<p>“I’m not going to try,” responded Jerry.
“Please do as I say, doctor. We must lose no
time. Get the planks and hitch up, please. I’ll
get you over the bridge.”</p>

<p>Soon the rig was ready. The boards stuck out
ahead and behind the carriage, in which the doctor
seated himself with his driver. While the boy
rode his machine to the bridge the doctor urged the
horse to a gallop, and soon the structure was
reached.</p>

<p>“Now what is your plan, Jerry?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[157]</a></span></p>

<p>“I’ll show you, sir. Quick, get out the planks
and lay them over the gap.”</p>

<p>The driver soon had the two boards in position.
They formed a narrow and not very steady temporary
bridge over where the black water showed
below the missing span.</p>

<p>“Can you walk across, doctor?” inquired Jerry.</p>

<p>“I guess so, my head is pretty steady,” was the
reply.</p>

<p>“Then cross, and I’ll follow with my machine,”
said the boy.</p>

<p>It took the doctor but a few seconds to cross
the planks, carrying his medicine case. Then
Jerry, pushing his machine on one plank, and
walking on the other, joined the physician.</p>

<p>“Tell your driver to come back for you in about
two hours,” suggested Jerry. “If the lady is going
to get better I guess you can safely leave by
that time.”</p>

<p>“Well, you seem to have the matter all
planned,” said the doctor smiling, as he called
the order to his driver. “But still I don’t see
how I am to get to Mrs. Johnson’s unless I
walk.”</p>

<p>“You’re going on my motor cycle,” said Jerry.
“You can stand on the back step, and hold on to
me. This machine will carry two.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[158]</a></span></p>

<p>“All right,” agreed the physician. “I must
take the risk, I guess.”</p>

<p>“Well, you won’t be taking any more of a risk
than that youngster did, doc,” interrupted a voice,
and the man who had warned Jerry came up. He
had several planks with him.</p>

<p>“I watched him shoot across that gap,” he went
on, “and it made me shiver. I thought sure he’d
be killed. I hollered at him to wait, as I had some
planks, but I guess he didn’t hear me.”</p>

<p>“I heard somebody, but I couldn’t stop,” Jerry
said.</p>

<p>“And do you mean to say you leaped across that
missing span?” asked the doctor.</p>

<p>“That’s what he done, doc,” said the man.
“It was as nervy a thing as I ever seen, and I
never seen it outside of a circus.”</p>

<p>“It wasn’t anything,” said Jerry modestly. “I
had to get across, and that was the only way. But
we are wasting time. Come on, doctor.”</p>

<p>So, with a nervous dread in his heart, the physician
got on the rear step, and clasped Jerry about
the shoulders.</p>

<p>“Give us a start,” Jerry asked of the countryman,
for the boy found it hard to pedal the machine
up grade with the added weight of his passenger.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[159]</a></span></p>

<p>The shove gave the motor start enough so that
Jerry could turn on the power, and then he rode
off, bearing the much-needed physician. In a comparatively
short time they reached the Johnson
house.</p>

<p>“Oh, I’m so glad you came, doctor!” exclaimed
the woman’s husband. “I’m afraid
you’re too late though.”</p>

<p>“We’ll see,” said the physician cheerfully, as he
dismounted from the rather uncomfortable step
and hurried into the house.</p>

<p>While the doctor found that Mrs. Johnson was
in much pain and suffering, he soon discovered that
she was not in danger of immediate death, though
her symptoms were alarming enough to cause herself
and her husband much fear. The physician
was able to afford some relief, and in about an
hour the woman was much better, and, so the
physician said, on the road to recovery.</p>

<p>“But I only got here just in time,” the physician
remarked. “If she had suffered from such
great pain much longer it would have weakened her
heart so that the results might have been serious.
You owe a great deal to this brave boy, Mr. Johnson.
Only for him, and for his ingenuity in getting
me here, the case might have had a different
ending.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[160]</a></span></p>

<p>“I realize that,” said the man, “and I can’t
thank him enough. The other two boys aided me
also. I don’t know what I would have done without
them. They helped me heat water and in
other ways. I am sure I’ll never forget it.”</p>

<p>After seeing that his patient was as comfortable
as possible the physician said he would return
home.</p>

<p>“I’ll send you as far as the bridge in a carriage,”
proposed Mr. Johnson. “That is if one
of these boys can drive you and bring the rig back.
I don’t feel like leaving Mrs. Johnson yet.”</p>

<p>“I’ll drive,” volunteered Ned.</p>

<p>So he hitched up a horse and soon the doctor
was ready to go, saying he would call again the
next day.</p>

<p>“You boys had better stay here all night,” invited
Mr. Johnson. “I’ll be glad to have you,
and it’s so late now you can’t get to Cresville.”</p>

<p>“What will our folks say?” asked Bob. “You
know they might worry if we didn’t come home.”</p>

<p>“There is a telegraph station not far from my
house,” put in Dr. Rand. “A message can be
sent to Cresville from there.”</p>

<p>So it was arranged. Ned drove the doctor
back, and found that in the meantime the bridge
had been repaired so that the passage was safer,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[161]</a></span>
though a horse could not be driven over it. The
physician promised to send the message to the boys’
parents, and, leaving Ned, Dr. Rand walked across
the planks, got in his own carriage and drove home,
while Ned made his way back to Mr. Johnson’s.</p>

<p>The sick woman continued to improve and soon
was much better. Mr. Johnson secured the services
of some women neighbors who were brought
to his house by Ned in the carriage, and arrangements
were made for the boys to spend the night.</p>

<p>The next morning Mrs. Johnson was so much
better that she insisted on sitting up and having
a talk with the three boys, whose coming was so
fortunate for her. She had high praise for them,
especially for Jerry, who blushed like a girl.</p>

<p>“I hear you all come from Cresville,” said Mrs.
Johnson. “Isn’t that where a mill was robbed
not long ago?”</p>

<p>“Some one took one thousand dollars from Mr.
Judson’s place,” answered Ned, wondering what
was coming.</p>

<p>“I think the thieves must have got some of my
money.”</p>

<p>“Your money? What do you mean?” asked
Ned. “I thought it was all Mr. Judson’s.”</p>

<p>“It was. I mean that I paid a bill at the mill
the afternoon of the night the robbery took place.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[162]</a></span>
Mr. Judson took my money, together with some
other that he had in a box, and locked it all in the
safe. It was quite late, and he said that he would
not have time to go to the bank.”</p>

<p>“Oh!” cried Ned. “Then some of the money
you paid was taken, for it was the very money that
Mr. Judson didn’t take to the bank that was
stolen.”</p>

<p>“Then there ought to be a clue to the thief,”
went on Mrs. Johnson.</p>

<p>“How?” asked Jerry.</p>

<p>“Because with the money I paid was a queer
looking bill,” said the woman. “It was from
some Massachusetts state bank, instead of a national
note, and it had a funny mark on it.”</p>

<p>“Do you remember what that mark was?”
asked Ned, while the other boys waited in breathless
silence.</p>

<p>“I remember it very well,” said Mrs. Johnson.
“There was a monogram of three letters. I recall
them very distinctly because they were the initials
of my brother’s name. He is dead, so of
course he could not have put them on the bill, but
some one with the same initials did.”</p>

<p>“And what were the letters?” asked Jerry.</p>

<p>“They were H. R. C.,” was the answer.</p>

<p>The boys, who recalled the initials on the queer<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[163]</a></span>
bill that Paul Banner had received from Noddy
Nixon, were too startled to reply. They did not
know what to say.</p>

<p>“That certainly ought to furnish a clue,” said
Jerry at length, making a sign to Ned and Bob
to say nothing. “But the police do not know that;
or, if they do, they have made nothing of it.”</p>

<p>“I think I’ll write and tell them,” said Mrs.
Johnson. “It seems a shame for Mr. Judson to
lose all that money.”</p>

<p>“Perhaps that would be a good plan,” Jerry
said quietly. “What was the value of the queer
bill?”</p>

<p>“It was a ten dollar note,” replied Mrs. Johnson.</p>

<p>After some further conversation the boys, finding
there was nothing more they could do, decided
they had better start for home. They were prevailed
on, however, to remain for dinner and,
shortly after that meal, the doctor having come in
the meanwhile and pronouncing Mrs. Johnson out
of danger, the three chums motored to Cresville,
where they arrived at dusk.</p>

<small>CLOSING THE NET.</small></h2>


<p>“Well, things seem to be narrowing down,”
said Ned the next day, when he called on Jerry.
“Rather odd, that information about the queer
bank bill coming out, wasn’t it?”</p>

<p>“It certainly was,” agreed Jerry. “I want to
get another look at the note Paul has. Suppose I
hunt him up this afternoon?”</p>

<p>“Good idea,” commented Ned.</p>

<p>Accordingly Jerry looked up the dapper “Polly,”
and, after a general conversation, managed to turn
the talk to odd coins and bank bills.</p>

<p>“Do you remember that queer bill you showed
me one day, not long ago?” asked Jerry.</p>

<p>“I do,” replied Paul.</p>

<p>“Have you got it yet?”</p>

<p>“No, my dear boy, I have not,” answered Paul,
lighting one of his perfumed Egyptian cigarettes.</p>

<p>“What&mdash;what did you do with it?” asked
Jerry, fearing lest the clue he hoped for had gotten
away from him.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[165]</a></span></p>

<p>“I&mdash;humph! That’s queer, I forget now
what I did do with it. Oh, yes! I remember
now. Some young chap, a friend of yours I guess,
asked me to sell it to him. He said he thought
there was a premium on it. He gave me eleven
dollars for it. I made one dollar, so I was satisfied.
You know you said you were going to see
if the bill had any value, but I guess you forgot
it.”</p>

<p>“I did, for a fact,” said Jerry, sorry now he
had not remembered to do as he had promised.
“But who has the bill now?”</p>

<p>“I forget the boy’s name I sold it to,” Paul
said in reply, “but he talks very fast, is always
in a hurry, and doesn’t seem to have time to
breathe.”</p>

<p>“Andy Rush, I’ll bet a cooky,” cried Jerry.</p>

<p>“That’s the name. I thought first it was Andy
Hurry, but I remember now, it was Rush. It’s
the same thing.”</p>

<p>“Pretty nearly,” agreed Jerry. “Well, I’ll be
going I guess.”</p>

<p>In due time Andy Rush returned from his visit
to his aunt. Jerry heard of his home-coming and
soon hunted up the rapid chap.</p>

<p>“Did you get home all right?” burst out Andy
as soon as he caught sight of Jerry. “My but<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[166]</a></span>
that was a storm&mdash;wish you could have stayed
with me&mdash;I had jolly fun&mdash;the horse ran away
with me&mdash;I got chased by a bull&mdash;fell in the
ditch&mdash;sprained my wrist, and got kicked by a
cow&mdash;whoop!”</p>

<p>“I say Andy,” broke in Jerry, anxious to get
on the subject that interested him, “have you a
queer bank bill that you got from Paul Banner?”</p>

<p>“I have!” exclaimed Andy. “I gave him a
dollar extra for it. I thought it might be valuable&mdash;no
go&mdash;bill is just like any other&mdash;no
premium&mdash;I’m out a dollar&mdash;too bad!”</p>

<p>“I’ll buy it from you for just what you gave for
it,” said Jerry eagerly. “I want it for a particular
purpose. Will you sell it?”</p>

<p>“I sure will!” cried Andy. “I don’t like to
lose money&mdash;here it is&mdash;glad you spoke&mdash;I
would have spent it in a week.”</p>

<p>Jerry, who happened to have the necessary
amount with him, passed eleven dollars over to
Andy, and received the odd ten dollar note.</p>

<p>Bidding the boy who was always in a hurry a
good-bye Jerry left. As soon as he was where he
could not be observed he examined the bank note
closely. It tallied exactly with the description
given by Mrs. Johnson, just as Jerry had expected
it would from his former view of it.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[167]</a></span></p>

<p>When Ned told his father of the latest developments
Mr. Slade said he would take the matter
under advisement. At his direction Jerry handed
over the queer bill, Mr. Slade paying what the boy
had expended for it.</p>

<p>“I will keep it,” said the merchant, “until the
time comes to use it. Meanwhile you boys had better
say nothing about the matter.”</p>

<p>It was three days later when the chums, having
gone for a short ride on their motors, stopped one
afternoon at a little wayside refreshment booth,
where the proprietor had cakes, candy, ice cream
and soda water for sale.</p>

<p>While the boys were eating their refreshments
in the shade of a canvas awning the owner of the
stand had put up, a horse and carriage, rapidly
driven, passed along the road.</p>

<p>The driver pulled his beast up quickly as he
came opposite the booth, and jumped out.</p>

<p>“Hi, Bill,” he called to his companion, who was
in the carriage. “Come here and we’ll wet our
whistle. I’m as dry as a chip.”</p>

<p>“It’s Noddy Nixon, and Bill Berry is with
him!” exclaimed Jerry. “I hope they don’t
bother us.”</p>

<p>“You’re not afraid, are you?” asked Ned.</p>

<p>“Not a bit, but I don’t want a row here.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[168]</a></span></p>

<p>Noddy did not appear to notice the three boys.
He ordered some lemon soda in a blustering tone,
and when he paid for it pulled out quite a roll of
bills.</p>

<p>“Where’d you get all the money?” the boys
heard Bill ask Noddy.</p>

<p>“Oh, I had a little and Jack Pender loaned me
the rest,” said Noddy with a laugh. “Jack’s a
soft mark. He’d give me all he had.”</p>

<p>“I wish I could find some one as accommodating,”
said Bill with a chuckle, as he drained his
glass.</p>

<p>“Come on!” cried Noddy. Then he cast a
look over to where the chums were sitting. He
started to walk toward them and seemed about to
say something.</p>

<p>“Keep quiet!” the boys heard Bill advise
Noddy, at the same time grasping him by the arm.
“Don’t raise a row with those cubs again. They
know too much now!”</p>

<p>“All right!” growled Noddy. “I’d like to
punch their heads, though.”</p>

<p>Then he and Bill got in their carriage and drove
away at a rapid pace.</p>

<p>“Punch our heads!” muttered Bob. “I’d
like to see him try it. He’s always talking of it.
Why doesn’t he do it?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[169]</a></span></p>

<p>“I guess he knows it wouldn’t be healthy,” said
Jerry.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XXI" id="CHAPTER_XXI">CHAPTER XXI.</a><br />
<small>PRACTICE FOR THE RACE.</small></h2>


<p>“We must begin track work,” said Jerry one
afternoon, when the three chums, having been out
on a spin, stopped beneath the shade of a road-side
tree. “A week from to-day the races take place.”</p>

<p>“I think we are all in pretty good trim, and so
are the machines,” ventured Bob.</p>

<p>“That part’s all right, Chunky,” came from
Ned, “but what we want is track work, as Jerry
says. Nothing like getting right on the ground.
Besides, we have been speeding on a wide road,
where we have all the room we want. It will be
different when there are twenty riders on a narrow
track, each one wanting to get inside.”</p>

<p>Ned and Bob agreed that it would be the very
thing needed. Accordingly the next morning,
early, saw the three boys at the track of the Cresville
Athletic Club. Though it was little more
than eight o’clock the chums found about a dozen
riders with their motors “warming-up” on the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[171]</a></span>
banked oval. The explosions of the numerous
gasolene engines sounded like a miniature battle.</p>

<p>“If any one challenges you to a little sprint,
accept it,” said Jerry to Ned and Bob, “but don’t
attempt to win.”</p>

<p>“Why not?” asked Ned, always ready to take
sides.</p>

<p>“Tell you later,” was all Jerry had time to
say, for just then two young men rode up to our
heroes.</p>

<p>“What do you fellows say to a little sprint for
a few miles around the track,” inquired one young
man, who wore a blue sweater.</p>

<p>“Just a practice warm-up,” put in the other,
who was attired in a pair of pink racing trousers.
“It’s rather dull going around this way, you
know.”</p>

<p>“We don’t mind a little race,” said Jerry.
“Just for fun, however.”</p>

<p>“Of course. What sort of a start do you prefer,
flying or from a standstill?”</p>

<p>“Flying will suit us,” Ned put in.</p>

<p>“All right. Come on, we’ll ride around once
together, line up at the judge’s stand, and make a
four-mile circuit.”</p>

<p>This was agreeable to the boys and they prepared
for the start with their unknown rivals. They all<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[172]</a></span>
came up to the line opposite the judges’ stand in
good formation.</p>

<p>“Go!” shouted the youth in the blue sweater.</p>

<p>Each contestant turned more power into his motor
and the machines whizzed around the track in
good time. It was easy to see that the two strangers
were trying to get a “line” on the speeds of
the motors of the three chums.</p>

<p>Both of the youths who had been so anxious for
the sprint watched with eager eyes every motion
of Bob, Ned and Jerry. But the latter, under the
direction of Jerry, did not operate their motors at
top speed. This was what the strangers wanted.
They desired to see just how fast the machines of
the Cresville boys could go, so as to know what
sort of competitors they would have when the big
event came on.</p>

<p>All the efforts of the two schemers to get either
of our three heroes to “make pace” for them
failed. Bob, Ned and Jerry just went around easily,
sometimes taking the lead, and again dropping
behind. The impromptu race was finally ended
with the motors running about three-quarters
speed, and Jerry and Ned just a little in the lead.</p>

<p>“You two win!” cried the youth in the blue
sweater. “Pretty good machines you have
there.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[173]</a></span></p>

<p>“They’ll do,” agreed Jerry, determined that the
strangers should not find out that they had been
suspected. “And we went at a pretty good clip,
while it lasted.”</p>

<p>“No doubt,” commented the lad in the blue
sweater. Plainly the two plotters were disappointed.
They had not succeeded in taking the
speed-measure of the three chums.</p>

<p>The track was now well filled with those practicing
for the coming race. More than a score
were scooting around on their machines. Few motors
were as fine and complete as those of the three
chums and not many had the double cylinder improvement.</p>

<p>“Shall we go around again?” asked Ned.</p>

<p>“I think we’d better,” counseled Jerry. “That
sprint was nothing. What we most need is to ride
in a big crowd and not lose our nerve when we
think there is going to be a collision.”</p>

<p>“I hope there will be no smash-ups,” came from
Bob. “If I thought that I wouldn’t go in.”</p>

<p>“There will not be any if you are careful,” advised
Jerry. “Just keep your wits about you and
mind your steering. Poor steering is responsible
for more accidents than anything else.”</p>

<p>“What do you suppose those two chaps wanted
to see how fast we could go for?” asked Bob.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[174]</a></span></p>

<p>“They wanted to know just what sort of opposition
they might count on,” replied Jerry.</p>

<p>“I don’t think those fellows gained much,” said
Ned.</p>

<p>“Me either,” commented Jerry. “Another
thing we must look out for is a ‘pocket.’”</p>

<p>“What’s that?” asked Bob, who was not very
well up on racing terms.</p>

<p>“You’ll see in a minute,” said Jerry.</p>

<p>He speeded up his motor. At the sound of
the quicker explosions there were hasty glances at
the youth on the part of many strangers. Jerry
was off down the track in a trice. The next instant
a dozen riders had taken after him, anxious
to see what his machine could do. But Jerry was
too wise to be caught.</p>

<p>He pretended to be trying to get more revolutions
from his motor, but, in reality he was throttling
down the gasolene and advancing the spark,
which made the reports quicker but which did not
increase his speed.</p>

<p>The bunch of a dozen riders soon surrounded
Jerry. He continued to speed away, but in a few
moments he found himself in the apex of a “V”
shaped gathering of contestants. They were
ahead and on either side of him; a veritable pocket,
from which there was no way out so close were the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[175]</a></span>
riders bunched. As soon as Jerry would try to
pass any one the others would crowd in front and
prevent it.</p>

<p>Finally Jerry shut off the power of his machine,
and with a laugh at the efforts of those who
thought they were fooling him, he came to a halt,
and dismounted.</p>

<p>“Smart kid, that,” commented one of the older
riders. “Up to snuff!”</p>

<p>“Thinks he is,” growled the youth in the blue
sweater. “He and those other two with him
fooled me a while ago. I couldn’t get a rise out
of him.”</p>

<p>“Now you see what a pocket is,” said Jerry as
he joined his chums. “If you get into one do
your best to ride out, or you’ll lose the race, providing
the others stick together and have made up
their mind to let one of their number win.”</p>

<p>The practice continued for some time. A little
before noon there was a stir at the track entrance
and a motor cycle, painted a bright red on every
available space shot on the track. The loudness
of the explosions told that it was a machine of
high power, and it attracted considerable attention.</p>

<p>“There’s a faster machine than ours,” called
Jerry.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[176]</a></span></p>

<p>“Yes, and do you see who’s riding it?” asked
Ned.</p>

<p>“No. Who?”</p>

<p>“Jack Pender.”</p>

<p>“Is that Noddy’s machine painted over?”</p>

<p>“No, it looks like a new one,” said Ned.
“Yes, it is a new one,” he added as he got a closer
view of the motor which swept by at that instant.</p>

<p>“If he goes in the race we’ll have to look sharp
if we want our touring car,” Jerry remarked.</p>

<p>Jack Pender did not seem to care to have anything
to say to the three chums, and neither did
they seek to speak to the bully’s toady. Bob, Ned
and Jerry rode together around the track for several
minutes, while Jack occasionally passed them,
making swift speed.</p>

<p>“Guess I’ll go off and get some dinner,” Jerry
announced finally. He was opposite the gate by
which riders left the track and steered for it. He
looked and saw Jack coming toward him, but noted
that the latter would, in the natural course of
events, pass behind him.</p>

<p>“Look out there! What’s the matter with
you?” cried Jack in sudden anger. Jerry glanced
around in time to see the rider of the red machine
steering directly for him, having left his course to
do so. A collision was imminent, and only by a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[177]</a></span>
skillful handling of his machine did Jerry so manage
that Jack only struck the rear wheel with his
front one.</p>

<p>“What are you trying to do?” cried Jerry.</p>

<p>“What are you up to?” retorted Jack. “You
got right in my way!”</p>

<p>“And I say you deliberately left your path to
try and run me down!” cried Jerry.</p>

<p>“It’s false!” exclaimed Jack, getting off his motor.</p>

<p>“It is not, and I’ll leave it to any one who saw
it,” spoke Jerry sharply. He was very angry.</p>

<p>“That’s right; you had plenty of room to pass
him,” said a quiet dark man, who had been making
several rounds of the track. “I don’t know
either of you, but the man on the red machine is to
blame.”</p>

<p>“Mind your own business!” snapped Jack.</p>

<p>“Look here, my young friend,” said the dark
man, as he got off his machine and came close to
Jack. “I would advise you to be a little more
careful of your language and your conduct. You
were either foolishly or deliberately careless in this
matter. This track is for gentlemen, remember.”</p>

<p>“What affair of yours is it?” asked Jack with
a growl.</p>

<p>“I am one of the directors of the club, and I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[178]</a></span>
will most certainly make it my affair, if necessary.”</p>

<p>Jack had nothing more to say, and turned off
the track with his loud-puffing machine.</p>

<p>“Did he damage your motor any?” asked the
man of Jerry.</p>

<p>“I guess not,” was the answer.</p>

<p>“If you want to make a complaint to the club
I will be a witness for you,” went on the director
of the organization.</p>

<p>“No, I had rather drop it now,” replied Jerry.
“I thank you, just the same.”</p>

<p>“He and Noddy make a nice team, don’t
they?” inquired Ned, he and Bob having followed
Jerry from the track.</p>

<p>“Well, I suppose it comes natural for them to
be mean,” replied Jerry. “The only thing to do
is to avoid trouble, but not to give in too much.”</p>

<p>“I wonder if he is going in the race with that
red machine? If so we’ll have to hustle,” commented
Ned.</p>

<p>“That’s what races are for,” said Jerry, with a
smile.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XXII" id="CHAPTER_XXII">CHAPTER XXII.</a><br />
<small>JACK PENDER’S TRICK.</small></h2>


<p>It was on Saturday, when they had once more
gone to the track for practice, that the boys had
another encounter with Noddy Nixon and Jack
Pender. The three chums had been making several
rounds, and, as it was rather warm, had left
the oval and gone to lie down in the shade of some
trees. Their machines they had left in the rear of
the club house, not far away.</p>

<p>“Do you know what I think we ought to do?”
asked Bob as he reclined at length in the grass,
chewing a straw.</p>

<p>“What new plan have you on foot now,
Chunky? A scheme to get some one to race for
you, or an arrangement to get out of training?”
asked Jerry.</p>

<p>“Neither one,” was the reply, “but I think we
ought to begin to think of what we will do with
our touring automobile.”</p>

<p>“Wait until one of us wins it,” advised Ned.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[180]</a></span>
“We don’t stand any better chance than a dozen
others.”</p>

<p>From off in the distance there sounded the loud
explosions of an approaching motor cycle.</p>

<p>“That’s Noddy’s machine,” said Jerry. “I
hope he doesn’t come around here bothering us.”</p>

<p>The noise sounded nearer and, in a few minutes
Noddy rode up on his cycle. He got off, ran his
machine close to where the three chums had stored
theirs, and then came to where Bob, Ned and Jerry
were taking their ease.</p>

<p>“You fellows going in the race?” asked Noddy,
in rather more friendly tones than he was in the
habit of using to those he did not care for.</p>

<p>“We expect to,” answered Jerry.</p>

<p>“And you think you’ll all win, I s’pose?” went
on the bully, in a sneering tone.</p>

<p>“One of us hopes to take a prize,” said Jerry,
preserving a calm voice.</p>

<p>“You haven’t any of you one chance in a hundred,”
said Noddy decidedly. “Some of the best
motor cyclists in the country are going in the race.”</p>

<p>“I guess we stand as good a chance as any one,”
put in Ned. “This isn’t like bicycle riding. A
great deal depends on the machine, and we have
good ones.”</p>

<p>“I tell you none of you can win.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[181]</a></span></p>

<p>“You wait and see,” advised Jerry.</p>

<p>“Do you want to back your opinion with any
money?” asked Noddy. “If you do, say the
word and I’ll bet you any amount.” He pulled
out quite a roll of bills.</p>

<p>“We don’t bet,” returned Jerry quietly.</p>

<p>“Oh! I suppose you’re afraid you’ll lose,”
came with a sneer.</p>

<p>“No, it isn’t that,” went on Jerry, looking the
bully square in the eye. “We don’t bet on principle,
but we do think we’ll win, and, if we did bet it
would not be with you, Noddy Nixon.”</p>

<p>“Do you mean to say I’m not good enough to
bet with?” demanded Noddy, advancing toward
Jerry.</p>

<p>“I didn’t say that, but you can take my remark
any way you choose,” replied Jerry.</p>

<p>“And I’ll take it that you want to insult me!”
exclaimed the bully.</p>

<p>“Very well.”</p>

<p>“And I allow no one to insult me without paying
for it,” proceeded Noddy, in a blustering tone.
“You’ll have to fight me.”</p>

<p>“Look here!” exclaimed Jerry. “You seem
to want to pick a quarrel, Noddy Nixon. Let me
tell you I’m not afraid of you. I don’t want to
fight, but, if I have to you’ll be the first to cry<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[182]</a></span>
‘quits.’ I’m not anxious to fight, but I’m not
going to run away.”</p>

<p>“Nor I!” cried Ned and Bob.</p>

<p>“You can fight us all, one after the other,” suggested
Ned.</p>

<p>“You mind your own business; I wasn’t talking
to you,” called Noddy, now thoroughly angry.</p>

<p>“The business of one of us is the business of
all of us,” replied Jerry with a laugh. “Better
be careful Noddy.”</p>

<p>The bully growled out something in reply, and
cast a glance over his shoulder. He gave a start
as he did so, and then, turning quickly made off
on his machine. Jerry looked in the direction
Noddy had peered.</p>

<p>“We’d better be getting over to our machines,”
said Jerry suddenly. “I thought I saw some one
moving about near them.”</p>

<p>“Only boys watching to see how they work,”
said Bob, who felt too comfortable to move.</p>

<p>“I’m going over to see who they are, though.
Looks like a pretty big boy, and I don’t want my
machine put out of gear when the race is only
four days off.”</p>

<p>“That’s so, those youngsters might get something
out of kilter,” agreed Ned, springing up.</p>

<p>He and Jerry went over to where the motors<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[183]</a></span>
had been left. The cycles were surrounded by
a crowd of small boys, but, as Jerry had remarked,
one of the lads seemed to be well grown. Suddenly
the group of youngsters parted and a tall
youth came from their midst. He glanced in the
direction of Jerry and Ned, and then, with a quick
motion, broke into a run. He hurried around the
corner of the club house and, the next instant there
came the sound of a motor cycle in motion. A
second later a red machine was observed moving
off in the distance.</p>

<p>“That was Jack Pender!” cried Jerry.</p>

<p>“That’s who it was!” agreed Ned. “And
he was up to some trick, I’ll bet.”</p>

<p>“If he’s damaged my machine he’ll pay for it,”
vowed Jerry.</p>

<p>The two boys, who were joined by Bob in a
little while, reached their machines. The crowd
of small lads who had not gone watched the three
chums as they made a careful examination of their
wheels.</p>

<p>“That fellow said he was fixing them,” volunteered
a little boy in short trousers.</p>

<p>“What fellow?” asked Ned.</p>

<p>“The one that just went away from here. He
had a wrench and screw driver and he was doing
something to the engine.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[184]</a></span></p>

<p>“Who was he?” asked Jerry, wanting to make
sure.</p>

<p>“I know! It was Jack Pender!” exclaimed
another of the small boys.</p>

<p>Jerry was the first to finish the examination of
his motor.</p>

<p>“Well, he’s fixed mine all right!” he exclaimed,
straightening up. “He’s taken off part of the
carburetor and the motor is no good until I get
a new one.”</p>

<p>“He’s done the same thing to mine!” cried
Ned, just discovering the damage which had been
done.</p>

<p>“And to mine,” added Bob.</p>

<p>“Boys, this is very serious,” said Jerry when
he had drawn his two chums out of hearing of the
group of small boys. “The machines can’t run
without those parts.”</p>

<p>“But can’t we easily get them?” asked Bob.</p>

<p>“We could in New York, or Boston or some
large city,” said Jerry. “But have we time to
send? To-day is Saturday, the race takes place
Thursday. We can’t get word to any supply store
until Monday morning, and it’s a question whether
we would receive the parts in time.”</p>

<p>“We can telegraph,” said Bob.</p>

<p>“Even that takes time. Jack Pender laid his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[185]</a></span>
plans well for this trick. He means to keep us out
of the race!” Jerry said.</p>

<p>“Can’t we get the parts in Cresville?” asked
Bob.</p>

<p>“Not a store keeps them that I know of,” replied
Jerry. “I’m afraid we’re done for. Most
likely Pender broke the parts and threw them
away.”</p>

<p>“No, we’re not done for!” exclaimed Ned.</p>

<p>“Why not?”</p>

<p>“Because I’ll ride into Boston to-night and get
the new parts!”</p>

<p>“But none of our machines can be run,” objected
Bob.</p>

<p>“I’ll borrow Mr. Wakefield’s,” said Ned.
“He’ll lend it to me when I tell him how the case
stands!”</p>

<p>“Hurrah!” exclaimed Bob. “You’re the stuff
Ned!”</p>

<p>“I doubt if you can do it,” objected Jerry.
“There is no moon to-night, and the roads are
hard to find.”</p>

<p>“I’m going to try,” insisted Ned. “Jack
Pender shall not keep us out of the race if I can
prevent it!”</p>

<p>“Well, hurry and find Mr. Wakefield,” urged
Jerry. “There’s no time to lose. Bob and I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[186]</a></span>
will see to your machine and you can start at
once.”</p>

<small>THE RIDE TO BOSTON.</small></h2>


<p>Ned found Mr. Wakefield, the athletic instructor,
in the gymnasium of the club house. The
boy hastily told him of the trouble, not however
mentioning Jack’s name.</p>

<p>“And, Mr. Wakefield,” said Ned, in great distress,
“if we can’t get those carburetor parts we
can’t race.”</p>

<p>“I’ll do all I can to help you,” said Mr. Wakefield.
“Take my machine and welcome.”</p>

<p>Ned really had quite a task before him. It
was a long ride to Boston, and there would be
no moon. Besides the roads were not of the best.
It was after four o’clock when he secured Mr.
Wakefield’s machine, and a half hour was lost
in oiling it up, and seeing that it was in shape for
the lengthy trip.</p>

<p>“I do not know whether to let you go or not,”
said Mr. Slade, when Ned broached the subject to
him.</p>

<p>“I really must go, father,” and Ned spoke so<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[188]</a></span>
earnestly that Mr. Slade was more than half persuaded.</p>

<p>“Well, I suppose it is hard to have to think
of giving up the race,” he said at length. “And
it seems to be the only way to do. So you may
go, but be very careful.”</p>

<p>“I will,” promised Ned.</p>

<p>He prepared himself for the trip, and was
about to start from his house, where he had taken
Mr. Wakefield’s machine, when Bob and Jerry
came along. They had wheeled their motors to
their houses, and brought Ned’s with them.</p>

<p>“Are you off?” asked Jerry.</p>

<p>“Just ready to start,” was the reply.</p>

<p>“You ought to be able to get the parts in any
automobile store,” said Jerry. “The only bad
feature of the trip will be coming home. I wish
I was going along.”</p>

<p>“Well, I haven’t any time to lose,” said Ned,
“so here goes!”</p>

<p>He leaped into the saddle, started the machine
off by means of the pedals and soon was puffing
down the road.</p>

<p>The start was made about half past five
o’clock, on a pleasant afternoon. The sun shone
through a hazy mist, and, though it had been
warm, it was cooler now. Because it was of an<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[189]</a></span>
earlier pattern, Mr. Wakefield’s machine was not
as speedy as any of the boys’, and Ned realized
he would have to be longer on the journey than if
he had his own fast motor.</p>

<p>“But I’m in luck to be able to get any machine
at all,” he said to himself.</p>

<p>For the first ten miles Ned had no trouble, as
he was familiar with the road. He had been riding
over an hour when he came to a small village
which, he learned by inquiry, was thirty miles from
the big city.</p>

<p>He rode out of the little town, and then, coming
to a place where several roads branched off was
puzzled which one to take, as there was no sign
posts. No house was near and no one seemed to
be traveling.</p>

<p>“I’ll take the middle road,” thought Ned.
“It’s trusting to chance, but it’s all I can do.”</p>

<p>He had ridden perhaps four miles when he met
a farmer driving a bony horse attached to a dilapidated
wagon. Poor, thin and old as the horse
was it seemed frightened at the sight of the machine,
and inclined to rear on its hind legs and
bolt.</p>

<p>“Is this the road to Boston?” asked Ned, knowing
he had little time to waste in talk, however
pleasant it might be.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[190]</a></span></p>

<p>“Wa’al ye kin git to it this way, but it’ll take
ye a long time. Ye’re going in a opposite direction.
Ye’d oughter taken the left hand road back
there at the forks.”</p>

<p>“Thanks,” said Ned, briefly, turning his machine
in readiness to go back and take the right
road.</p>

<p>“Hold on! Maybe I can make some kind of
a trade with ye for that threshing machine ye
got!” called the old man, but Ned, with a friendly
wave of his hand, started back to regain the right
road.</p>

<p>He resolved to be more careful next time in
taking roads where there was more than one. So,
when he again reached places where the highways
diverged he waited until some one came along, or
he went back to the last house he had passed, and
inquired.</p>

<p>He rode on for two hours longer. It was getting
a little dusky now because of the clouds, and
Ned began to fear he was in for a storm. He
wished he was at his destination, for, if worst came
to worst, he could stay in Boston all night, and
start back in the morning. But he soon saw evidences
that he was nearing some large city.
Houses became more frequent, and every now and
then he would pass through some settlement or<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[191]</a></span>
good sized suburb. Then, off in the distance, he
descried the Hub City.</p>

<p>“There’s Boston!” he cried. “Now for an
automobile or motor store.”</p>

<p>Getting on to good roads he speeded his machine
up as fast as it would go, which was not
overly rapid, and was soon riding through the
streets of the historic city.</p>

<p>He kept his eyes open, and presently saw an
automobile shop. The man was just closing up.</p>

<p>“Wait a minute!” called Ned. “Hold on!
I want to get something!”</p>

<p>“You’ll have to be quick,” said the man.</p>

<p>Ned lost no time in telling what he desired.</p>

<p>“Here’s what you want,” said the dealer.
“We got some new ones in to-day.”</p>

<p>“Thanks,” said Ned fervently, as he paid for
the articles. He stowed the precious parts safely
away in his pockets. Then he began to think of
supper. It was nearly ten o’clock, but he found
a small restaurant open, and made a hasty meal.
Then, lighting his own acetylene gas lamp, which
he had brought along in place of the oil affair
Mr. Wakefield carried, the boy prepared for his
homeward trip.</p>

<p>This was a very different thing from riding
along in the afternoon and early evening. If he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[192]</a></span>
was in doubt of a road he could find plenty of persons
to ask. But after dark every one seemed to
go to bed, as he noticed when he passed from the
immediate Boston suburbs into the country. Several
times Ned had to get off his machine and,
with his lamp for a torch, hunt around for a sign
post to tell him which road to take.</p>

<p>Once he came to where three roads divided.
He could find no friendly pointing finger to tell
him which one to take, and there was not a house
in sight. The last residence he had passed was
half a mile back. He did not relish going on the
wrong highway until he met some one to set him
right, nor did he want to retrace his journey.</p>

<p>“If only some one would come along now,” he
murmured.</p>

<p>By dint of making inquiries at many farm
houses Ned managed to cover about twenty miles
of his homeward trip. Then, as it grew later,
the friendly lights that shone from the lonely road-side
residences went out, and Ned began to think
his trip was going to be a rather unpleasant one
at the close, although it was still fairly clear. He
did not like to awaken people up to ask them about
the road, and it was evident that nearly every one
in the country had gone to rest.</p>

<p>It was very dark. His gas lamp gave a brilliant<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[193]</a></span>
thread of light directly in front of him, but
that was all. It was quiet, also, save for the chug-chug
of his motor. Now and then an owl would
hoot, and the sound, strange and weird, seemed to
chill Ned’s blood, though he knew what it was.</p>

<p>Once again the old trouble of coming to two
roads, and not knowing which to follow, confronted
him. It was close to midnight, and the
country was so deserted that for the last two miles
he had not passed a house. Nor did he know
how far in advance he might have to go before
reaching one.</p>

<p>“Shall I go to the right or left?” Ned asked
himself. “I’ll trust to luck, I’ll toss a stone up,
and take the road it falls nearest to.”</p>

<p>He had dismounted from his wheel, and, standing
at the fork of the roads, tossed a pebble into
the air. It fell on the left path.</p>

<p>“The left it is!” He got on his machine, rode
about a quarter of a mile, and then, with a loud
noise his rear tire burst. It came with such suddenness
and gave Ned such a shock that he nearly
tumbled from the motor.</p>

<p>“Here’s luck!” he exclaimed. He quickly discovered
that the break was a bad enough one to
mend in daylight to say nothing of attempting it in
the darkness.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[194]</a></span></p>

<p>“I guess I’m booked to stay here all night,”
the boy said. “If I could find a farm house near
by I’d ask to stay there.”</p>

<p>But he did not feel like pushing the heavy
motor along the road in a search.</p>

<p>“It’s warm, and I can stay out all night,” Ned
thought. “I’d like to get in shelter though.”</p>

<p>He paused in the middle of the dark road and
looked about him. Off to the left were fields.</p>

<p>“Looks like a lot of hay in that meadow,” he
told himself. “If it is that will be just the thing
to crawl into and go to sleep.” He walked closer
and peered at the dark objects that had attracted
his attention. He climbed the fence, and discovered
that his surmise was right.</p>

<p>Pulling and hauling the motor he got it through
the bars. Then, selecting a big mound of the fragrant
dried grass, Ned made a hole in it, crawled
in, curled up and, in spite of his queer bed, was
soon sound asleep.</p>

<hr class="chap" />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[195]</a></span></p>




<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XXIV" id="CHAPTER_XXIV">CHAPTER XXIV.</a><br />
<small>GETTING BACK HOME.</small></h2>


<p>The sun was shining in through the chinks of
the mound of hay the next morning when Ned
awoke.</p>

<p>“What! Why! Where in the world am I?”
he exclaimed. He had slept so hard, because of
the fatigue of his ride, that he could not remember
where he was.</p>

<p>“Oh I know now,” he said, at length, as the
recollection of his experience came to him.</p>

<p>He stretched, rolled out of his fragrant bed and,
brushing the wisps of hay from his hair, stepped
out into the glow of the sun. His first care was
to feel in his pocket to see if the carburetor parts,
that had cost him all his trouble, were safe. They
were all right, and then Ned began to think of
breakfast and getting home. He feared his parents
would be worried over his absence.</p>

<p>“Doesn’t seem to be a very thickly settled locality
around here,” observed Ned, taking a survey
and seeing nothing but fields and woods in the distance.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[196]</a></span>
“I guess I’m in for a long walk for breakfast.
And I’ve got to push that motor. I can’t
fix the tire with what tools I have along. Well,
there’s no help for it, and I suppose it will give me
a good appetite.”</p>

<p>He found Mr. Wakefield’s motor where it had
been left, covered with hay to keep off the dew.
Ned rolled it out into the road and then, hearing
the musical tinkle of a brook near by, he bethought
that a wash and a drink of cool water would not
come amiss.</p>

<p>He found a clear sparkling little meadow
stream. It raced and bubbled its way over the
white pebbles, and between banks of green grass
and moss.</p>

<p>“That looks good,” thought Ned, as he
stretched out at full length on his face and took a
long drink. Then he found a shallow little basin,
scooped out of a stone where the water formed a
pool, and there he washed and felt much refreshed.</p>

<p>“I’m still in the dark as to whether I’m on the
right road or not,” thought Ned. “But it’s daylight
now, and I might as well keep going this way
until I meet some one to inquire of.”</p>

<p>So he started off. He was hungry and wished
very much for something to eat. It was no fun
pushing the heavy motor cycle along the dusty<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[197]</a></span>
road, but Ned dared not leave it behind on the
highway for fear something might happen to it.</p>

<p>He had gone about a mile, perhaps, when down
the road he saw a farm wagon, to which was
hitched a team of horses, approaching.</p>

<p>“Here comes some one at last,” Ned thought,
“and I may get a lift.”</p>

<p>“Hello bub!” exclaimed the driver of the
horses, a jolly-looking blue-eyed farmer, when the
wagon came opposite Ned. “Had a smash up?”</p>

<p>“No, only a tire broken,” replied the boy.
“But can you tell me whether this is the way to
Cresville?”</p>

<p>“Well, you could get there on this road, but it’s
about five miles out of your way. Is that where
you want to go?”</p>

<p>“It’s where I live,” Ned answered. “I went
to Boston yesterday, and on my way back last
night I lost my way, my machine broke, and I had
to sleep in a hay stack.”</p>

<p>“I see you did,” observed the farmer. “Some
of the grass is in your hair yet.”</p>

<p>Ned hastily removed the traces of his recent
bed.</p>

<p>“But if you’re going to Cresville,” went on the
man, “I can give you a lift. I’m going within
three miles of there.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[198]</a></span></p>

<p>“I’d be much obliged if you would,” spoke
Ned.</p>

<p>“Well, pile your machine in back there, and
climb up on the seat,” was the invitation, and
Ned did so.</p>

<p>“You don’t happen to know of any restaurants
around here, do you?” he asked the driver.</p>

<p>“No, nothing open on Sunday.”</p>

<p>“Sure enough, it is Sunday!” cried Ned. “I’m
so upset I’d about forgotten it.”</p>

<p>“Sleeping in the hay instead of your bed sort
of put you off the track,” suggested the farmer.</p>

<p>“That’s what it did,” agreed Ned.</p>

<p>It was a beautiful morning and Ned thoroughly
enjoyed it as he rode along. Even the rough jolting
of the farm wagon was not unpleasant.</p>

<p>“I don’t usually travel in this kind of a rig on
Sundays,” explained the farmer. “But I have to
go over to Doddtown for some grain for the
horses, and I had to take this cart.”</p>

<p>“I’m glad you did,” said Ned. “If you had
been in a carriage I couldn’t have brought the
motor cycle with me.”</p>

<p>“No more you could,” spoke the farmer.
“Everything happens for the best after all. But
here you are. This is as far as I go on your way.
If you take that road,” pointing to where one<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[199]</a></span>
branched off from the highway the wagon was on,
“you’ll come to Cresville. Sorry I can’t take you
all the way, but it’s only three miles.”</p>

<p>“I’m much obliged to you for the lift,” said
Ned, getting the machine out of the wagon, and
bidding his new acquaintance good-bye.</p>

<p>Leaving the motor cycle at a house on the outskirts
of town, Ned reached home about noon, and
found his parents much alarmed. Jerry and Bob
were at his house, and there was talk of organizing
a searching party.</p>

<p>“Did you bring the carburetor parts?” asked
Jerry.</p>

<p>“I did!” exclaimed Ned, as he passed them
over.</p>

<p>“They’re all right,” announced Jerry, after an
inspection. “From now on we must take care
not to leave our machines out of our sight. But
what did you do with Mr. Wakefield’s motor?”</p>

<p>Ned told where it was. Then he had a bath,
and got ready for dinner. After the meal, which
his chums ate with him, Ned went and told Mr.
Wakefield what had happened to the motor. The
latter was not alarmed for the safety of his machine,
and it was arranged that one of the employees
of the club could drive over for it on
Monday. The rest of the day the boys spent<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[200]</a></span>
quietly, anxiously waiting for the morrow when
they might again try their motors.</p>

<p>Bright and early on Monday each boy was fitting
the new carburetor parts to his cycle. The
apparatus fitted perfectly and soon all three were
spinning down the road at a good speed. They
rode for several miles and were about to turn back,
on Jerry’s proposal to go to the athletic track,
when they heard the noise of an approaching
motor.</p>

<p>The next instant a machine turned the corner
of the road, and came toward them. All three
of the chums started as they saw that the rider
was Jack Pender. Hardly knowing what they
were doing, Ned, Bob and Jerry spread themselves
out across the highway so that Pender could not
pass. On his part he was so surprised that he
shut off the power of his machine and came to a
stop, just as the three chums, who had done likewise,
dismounted.</p>

<p>“Well?” observed Jerry quietly. “I’ve been
wanting to meet you, Jack.”</p>

<p>“Don’t you dare to touch me!” exclaimed Jack.
“If you do I’ll have you arrested.”</p>

<p>“You’re a nice one to talk about having people
arrested,” went on Jerry. “I’ve a good mind to
shake you!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[201]</a></span></p>

<p>“What did I do?” asked Jack, looking very
uncomfortable.</p>

<p>“You know well enough what you did. Tried
to fix our machines so they wouldn’t work by taking
off the carburetors. That’s what you did.”</p>

<p>“I didn’t mean to,” said Jack. “I was just&mdash;just
turning them and they came off.”</p>

<p>“You’d ought to be made to pay for the damage
you did,” put in Ned. “I had to go all the
way to Boston for new parts.”</p>

<p>“I haven’t any money,” whined Jack.</p>

<p>“You have enough to lend to Noddy Nixon,”
put in Bob, remembering that day when they had
met Noddy at the soda-water booth, and the bully
had boasted that Jack loaned him money.</p>

<p>“I never lent Noddy any money!” exclaimed
Jack.</p>

<p>“He said you did!” exclaimed Jerry.</p>

<p>“Well, he tells&mdash;what business is it of yours
any how?” Jack interrupted a statement he was
going to make. “I don’t have to tell you anything
about my affairs.”</p>

<p>“No one asked you to,” Ned put in. “All
we want is for you to let us and our machines
alone.”</p>

<p>“I think a good thrashing is what he needs,”
said Jerry, with mock severity, standing his machine<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[202]</a></span>
against Ned’s and advancing toward Jack.</p>

<p>“Oh no! Please don’t!” begged the young
coward. “I’ll never do anything again. Please
don’t lick me! Noddy Nixon made me do it!
Don’t touch me, and I’ll tell you everything!”</p>

<p>“Everything about what?” asked Jerry.</p>

<p>“About&mdash;about the&mdash;the mill robbery!” exclaimed
Jack.</p>

<p>“What do you know of it?” asked Ned in
amazement.</p>

<p>“I don’t know very much, but you watch Noddy
Nixon about six o’clock to-night,” replied Jack.
“There,” he burst out, “I promised I wouldn’t
tell, but he’s always getting me in trouble and
never helping me out.”</p>

<p>Then, before the boys could stop him, Jack
Pender turned his machine in the opposite direction,
leaped into the saddle and was soon moving
off swiftly down the road.</p>

<p>“Shall we chase him?” asked Ned.</p>

<p>“No, let him go,” replied Jerry. “We gave
him a good scare, and, besides, we want to be on
hand for something else.”</p>

<p>“What?”</p>

<p>“We want to watch Noddy to-night.”</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XXV" id="CHAPTER_XXV">CHAPTER XXV.</a><br />
<small>NODDY’S QUEER ACTIONS.</small></h2>


<p>For a few moments after Jerry had spoken
neither Ned nor Bob knew what to say. Events
had happened so rapidly, and they seemed on the
verge of such a discovery, that they were startled.
Jerry alone kept cool.</p>

<p>“What do you think Noddy will do?” asked
Ned.</p>

<p>“I might make a dozen guesses and not hit it,”
Jerry replied. “We can only wait and watch.”</p>

<p>“Shall we do it together?” inquired Bob.</p>

<p>“Hardly that,” spoke Jerry. “If he saw three
of us on his trail he would probably suspect something.
I have a plan.”</p>

<p>“What is it?” asked Ned.</p>

<p>“You know there are only three ways Noddy
can take after he leaves his house,” said Jerry.
“He can go up town, down town or he can take
the road that leads out to the old wind mill.”</p>

<p>“That’s so,” came from Bob.</p>

<p>“Now my idea is that we all three ought to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[204]</a></span>
keep watch,” went on Jerry. “If he goes up town
Ned can follow him. If he goes down town Bob
can take up the trail and if he goes out to the old
mill I will go after him.”</p>

<p>“All right,” Jerry said. “That settles it.
Now for home.”</p>

<p>Little talk was indulged in. Each of the three
chums felt that something of importance was to
happen and their thoughts were too busy for conversation.
In due time the boys separated, had
their dinners and suppers, and shortly before six
o’clock met by appointment in the post office,
which was a block from Noddy’s residence.</p>

<p>“Now remember,” said Jerry. “If he goes
up town you are to follow, Ned. Bob, it’s your
turn if he goes down, and if he takes the road to
the old mill I’ll follow.”</p>

<p>They had long waits, for it was nearly nine
o’clock before Noddy crept quietly from the rear
door in the darkness of the night. He did not
know that three pairs of sharp eyes watched his
every movement. Peering on every side of him
the bully quickly made his way to the street.
Then, after a moment’s hesitation he started rapidly
off in the direction of the old mill.</p>

<p>“Here goes!” said Jerry, who was on the look-out.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[205]</a></span></p>

<p>Like a shadow he glided from his hiding place
and was after Noddy. He kept a sufficient distance
in the rear so that he would not betray himself
by the sound of his footsteps. It was quite
dark, for there was no moon, but the stars were
bright.</p>

<p>“I wonder what he wants out here?” thought
Jerry. “Is he going to meet some one?”</p>

<p>To his surprise he saw Noddy, having halted
in front of the deserted mill, enter the dark and
uninviting place without hesitation.</p>

<p>“Ugh! I wouldn’t care to go in there alone,”
thought Jerry. “It looks spooky!”</p>

<p>He dared go no closer than the dilapidated
fence that surrounded the structure. Crouching
there in the shadow, he looked toward the mill, to
discern what went on. No one seemed to be waiting
for Noddy, nor did the bully show by his
actions that he expected any one. Shortly after he
had entered the place Noddy struck a light, as
Jerry could see. It flickered and moved about
some, but seemed to be kept in one room. Then,
in a few minutes, the light went out, and Jerry
heard footsteps approaching down the gravel walk
that led to the main entrance of the mill.</p>

<p>“He either went there to get something or hide
something,” Jerry reasoned. “If it was to hide<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[206]</a></span>
something I may discover what it was. If it was
to take something I have very little chance of success.”</p>

<p>Still hiding in the shadow of the fence Jerry
waited until Noddy had passed some distance down
the road.</p>

<p>“I don’t fancy going into that place very
much,” observed the boy, “but it’s got to be
done.”</p>

<p>Considerably against his inclinations, Jerry took
the dark path leading to the old mill. He started
at every sound, and when an owl hooted in a nearby
tree the boy jumped as if some one had yelled
at him.</p>

<p>With beating heart he made his way into the
deserted place. It was as dark as a pocket and
the boy struck a light.</p>

<p>“If I only had a candle,” he wished.</p>

<p>Hardly had he formed the thought when, glancing
down, he saw a short wax end on the floor.
He picked it up.</p>

<p>“This is the light Noddy had,” reflected Jerry.</p>

<p>He lighted the wick, and the illumination somewhat
dispelled the gloom. With eager eyes he
scanned the place. Moving about he held the candle
up where it would give a good light. But
nothing rewarded his search. From side to side<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[207]</a></span>
he went. Then he held the light close to the floor.
He had gone over almost every foot of surface and
found nothing.</p>

<p>“I guess it’s a wild-goose chase,” thought Jerry.
“But I’m sure Noddy did not go out of this room.
I watched the light. Hello! What’s that?”</p>

<p>He had suddenly struck his foot against a board
that projected somewhat above the others in the
floor.</p>

<p>“Queer I didn’t notice that before,” said Jerry.
He lowered the candle carefully. “Looks as if
it had been moved lately,” he went on.</p>

<p>Thrusting his fingers beneath the edge of the
board Jerry gave a strong pull. The plank did
not budge. He tried again without success. At
the third attempt, however, his strength availed,
and he felt the piece of flooring suddenly yield.
So quickly did it come from its place in fact that
Jerry fell backward, knocking out his candle and
leaving himself in utter darkness.</p>

<p>Quickly searching in his pocket the boy found
his matches, struck a light and ignited the candle
end. Then, with swiftly beating heart he peered
down into the hole he had disclosed. He was
rewarded by seeing a small wooden box, half covered
with dirt and rubbish. With trembling
fingers Jerry drew it forth and held it close to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[208]</a></span>
light. It was a square wooden receptacle with a
hinged cover.</p>

<p>“It’s the box that was stolen from the mill with
the thousand dollars in it!” exclaimed Jerry.</p>

<p>He raised the cover. If he had had any doubts
about his find they were dispelled when he saw the
contents of the box. It was half filled with papers,
seemingly of no value, but bearing the name of
Amos Judson. There were receipts, notes, bills
and memoranda. But there was no trace of the
money.</p>

<p>“I’ll take this away,” said the boy, “and have
a talk with Ned and Bob about it. I think&mdash;”</p>

<p>There came a sudden sound that startled the lad.
It was as if some one had stepped on the platform
outside of the mill. Jerry quickly blew out his
candle. Then, as he heard an owl hoot, he knew
it was the bird that had made the noise, and
breathed easier.</p>

<p>Not stopping to relight the candle, but replacing,
as best he could in the darkness the plank, so
the hole would not be noticed on a casual inspection,
Jerry hurried from the mill and made a quick
trip to Ned’s house. He felt that matters were
now at a crisis.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XXVI" id="CHAPTER_XXVI">CHAPTER XXVI.</a><br />
<small>NODDY NIXON CORNERED.</small></h2>


<p>As late as it was Jerry found his two chums
anxiously waiting for him.</p>

<p>“Well?” asked Ned.</p>

<p>“Here is something,” replied Jerry, showing
the box which he had concealed under his coat.
He told how he had found it and the three chums
examined the contents curiously.</p>

<p>“What had we better do?” asked Bob.</p>

<p>“I’ll tell you what I think,” spoke Ned. “We
ought to tell father. He will know what to do.”</p>

<p>Mr. Slade was plainly surprised at some of the
disclosures made, for, though he knew most of the
circumstances, he was not acquainted with all of
them. The boys had forgotten many details in
their previous recitals, and, of course, the finding
of the box was the latest occurrence.</p>

<p>“I must say you boys have sifted this thing
out pretty well,” said Mr. Slade. “You have a
great deal more information than have the police.”</p>

<p>“What had we better do about it?” asked<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[210]</a></span>
Jerry. “You see we are at a sort of stand-still
now.”</p>

<p>Mr. Slade thought for a few minutes.</p>

<p>“Here is what I would do,” he said at length.
“I would contrive to have a talk with Noddy
Nixon, all three of you. I understand he is a
sort of bully, but if the three of you are together
there is nothing to fear from him.</p>

<p>“Once you get him alone somewhere you can
tell him just what you know, and show him how
everything points to him as the person who robbed
the mill. It may be that the information will
overwhelm him, and he will own to everything.
Again, he may be innocent of everything, and able
to explain all of his acts satisfactorily. In that
case you will be glad that you made no public complaint.”</p>

<p>After a little thought the boys voted this was
the best thing to do. They arranged to send
Noddy a note asking him to meet one of them in a
secluded place the next day, and all three chums
promised to be on hand.</p>

<p>Early the next day the three boys met again.
In accordance with the arrangement of the night
before, Jerry had sent a note to Noddy, asking the
bully to meet him near the old wind mill.</p>

<p>“Come, for the matter is of great interest to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">[211]</a></span>
you,” the note had said, and Jerry had signed no
name. Ten o’clock was the hour set, and quite
a while before that time the three boys were at the
dilapidated structure.</p>

<p>“I think you two had better stay inside,” said
Jerry to Bob and Ned. “But remain where you
can see and hear everything. I’ll be out here when
Noddy comes.”</p>

<p>It was a few minutes after ten when Jerry saw
Noddy coming up the path that led to the main
mill entrance. No sooner had the bully caught
sight of Jerry than he started, and seemed about
to turn back.</p>

<p>“Don’t go!” called Jerry. “Did you get my
note?”</p>

<p>“Did you write that?”</p>

<p>“I certainly did.”</p>

<p>“What’s it all about?” growled Noddy. “If
you’re fooling me you’ll wish you hadn’t.”</p>

<p>“I guess you won’t think it’s much like fooling,”
replied Jerry. “In the first place, have you ever
seen this before?”</p>

<p>He suddenly held out the wooden box he had
found hidden in the mill. At the sight of it
Noddy started.</p>

<p>“Where&mdash;where did you get it?” Noddy
gasped.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">[212]</a></span></p>

<p>“Right here, in this mill,” was the answer. “I
took it out of a hole in the floor last night, right
after you had been here. It has some papers in
it from the Judson mill.”</p>

<p>Noddy started again. His face was pale, and
he trembled. His hands twitched nervously.</p>

<p>“What&mdash;what else?” he whispered.</p>

<p>“You might as well tell everything,” said Jerry.
“Ned saw you coming from the mill on the night
of the robbery with this box under your arm.
You said it had fish bait in it. We know how
thick you were with Bill Berry, and how he tried
to have the blame cast on Ned. And we know
something else.”</p>

<p>“What?”</p>

<p>“That you paid a bet to Paul Banner shortly
after the robbery.”</p>

<p>“Supposing I did?”</p>

<p>“Just this, we have&mdash;or, rather I have&mdash;one
of the bills you gave to Paul.”</p>

<p>“Well, what of that?” asked Noddy, trying to
maintain a brave air.</p>

<p>“Only this. It was a ten dollar bill, issued by
a state instead of a national bank, and it had the
initials H. R. C. on it in red ink. We have
learned that this bill was paid to Mr. Judson on
the afternoon before the robbery, that it was placed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">[213]</a></span>
in the box&mdash;this box&mdash;that was stolen from the
safe.”</p>

<p>“Supposing some one gave that bill to me before
I gave it to Paul?” asked Noddy.</p>

<p>“If you can prove that it will be a good thing
for you,” Jerry went on. “We have no desire,
Noddy, to fasten this on you, but Ned must be
cleared and the robbery mystery ended. Tell me
who gave you the queer bank bill?”</p>

<p>But Noddy kept silent.</p>

<p>“On the night of the mill fire,” Jerry went on,
“we found the hammer and chisel that were used
to cut the safe open, and also the dark lantern. If
anything more is needed, Bill Berry will&mdash;”</p>

<p>“If Bill Berry tells that he saw me in the
mill&mdash;!” cried Noddy, and then he stopped.</p>

<p>“We may need Bill’s testimony,” Jerry said.
“You see we have nearly everything, Noddy.
What have you to say?”</p>

<p>Noddy said nothing for a few minutes. He
seemed ill at ease. Then he burst out:</p>

<p>“I may as well confess! You cubs have spied
on me to good advantage. I had to take that
money! I needed it to pay my debts. I heard
Tom Judson say it was in the safe that afternoon.
I knew the old iron box was easy to crack. I had
no trouble to get in, and I began work. When I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">[214]</a></span>
was almost through I looked up, and saw Bill
Berry looking in at me. I offered to go shares
with him if he would keep quiet, and he did.
Then, after a while he said another man, a chum
of his, had seen me also, and I had to give him
money. He would have shot me if I hadn’t. It
was one night in a lonely house.”</p>

<p>Jerry nodded. He well remembered that night.</p>

<p>“Then,” went on Noddy, “Bill suggested
throwing the blame on Ned, because he was around
the mill that night. It didn’t work, however.
Now, I guess the game is up. What are you going
to do?”</p>

<p>“We’ll have to consider,” Jerry replied.</p>

<p>“We? Who is we?” asked Noddy.</p>

<p>“Bob, Ned, and myself.”</p>

<p>“Are they here?”</p>

<p>“They heard it all. We needed several witnesses,”
was the answer.</p>

<p>“Give me one day more,” pleaded the bully.
“I may be able to pay the money back then.”</p>

<p>“I’ll see what the others say,” replied Jerry.
“Come out, Ned and Bob.”</p>

<p>The two boys came from their place of concealment.
Noddy did not appear to notice them.</p>

<p>“You heard what he said,” spoke Jerry, “what
do you say?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">[215]</a></span></p>

<p>“One day more will do no harm,” said Bob,
who felt a little compassion for Noddy, unfriendly
as the bully had always been.</p>

<p>“All right,” said Jerry, and Ned nodded in assent
to the stout boy’s proposal. “We will say
nothing for another twenty-four hours, Noddy.
Meet us here at this time to-morrow and we will
decide what is to be done.”</p>

<p>“I will,” replied Noddy as he hurried away.</p>

<p>“Well, I’m glad that’s over,” remarked Jerry.
“I hated to do it, but I felt it ought to be done.
Now to go and tell Mr. Slade that Noddy has
confessed, and see what’s to be done to-morrow.”</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XXVII" id="CHAPTER_XXVII">CHAPTER XXVII.</a><br />
<small>NODDY NIXON’S MOVE.</small></h2>


<p>When Mr. Slade had been informed of the
outcome of the interview with Noddy, he said the
boys had acted with caution and wisely.</p>

<p>“We will see if Noddy intends to settle and pay
back the money,” said Ned’s father. “If he does
not it is only right that his father should be informed,
also the sheriff and Mr. Judson.”</p>

<p>There was nothing to do but to wait until the
next day. The three chums spent some time in
wondering what Noddy would do. Then Ned
exclaimed:</p>

<p>“Say, we’re forgetting all about the race. Here
it is Tuesday. The day after to-morrow we’ll have
to make a try for that touring car, and we ought
to be practicing.”</p>

<p>“Yes, and our wheels need overhauling,” suggested
Jerry. “I’m going to put in new batteries.
Don’t want to run any risk of the motor missing
explosions when we’re on the track, you know.”</p>

<p>This was voted a wise precaution, and the motor<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">[217]</a></span>
boys separated, to go home after their cycles, agreeing
to meet in the afternoon on the track for practice
runs.</p>

<p>Through a good part of the afternoon they went
around and around at moderate speed, testing their
motors thoroughly and practicing the turns. Others
were doing the same, and no especial attention
was drawn to our three heroes.</p>

<p>Along about five o’clock, most of the other prospective
contestants having gone off, Jerry suggested
it would be a good time to give the three motors a
friendly trial. Accordingly a flying start was
made from the judges’ stand, and each of the three
boys soon had his cycle going at almost top speed.</p>

<p>At first there seemed to be little to choose from
among them. They hung well together at the
start, and then Ned began to forge ahead a little.
He had acquired more momentum than the others,
perhaps, or the difference that exists in two motors
made exactly the same, gave his wheel one or two
more revolutions a minute than Jerry’s or Bob’s.</p>

<p>“Are you on full speed?” asked Jerry at length.</p>

<p>“No,” replied Ned and Bob.</p>

<p>“Turn on all the power you can,” was the suggestion.
“Let’s see what we really can do on the
track.”</p>

<p>The muffled explosions at once became more<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">[218]</a></span>
rapid. The wheels whizzed around the track
faster and faster, and Jerry and Bob began to
creep up on Ned, who was leading. Then they
passed him, and he was half a length behind.
Again Jerry forged in front of Bob, and it seemed
that the prize motor was going to prove the fastest.</p>

<p>But a careful eye could see that Bob was beginning
to regain his lost ground. The distance
between his wheel and Jerry’s lessened until, after
two more rounds Jerry and the stout youth were
riding exactly on a line. Ned was perhaps a
length behind.</p>

<p>“I guess this will do,” called Jerry. “Shut
down!”</p>

<p>Slowly the motors ceased their rapid explosions,
and after another turn of the track the three boys
came to a halt and dismounted.</p>

<p>“We’re pretty evenly matched,” said Ned.
“My machine didn’t do as well as I expected
though.”</p>

<p>They separated, arranging to be on hand at the
old mill at ten o’clock the following morning, to
clear up the last of the mill robbery mystery.</p>

<p>“Jerry, I wish you would take this message over
to Mrs. Northrup’s for me,” said Mrs. Hopkins to
her son, after supper that evening. “I want her
to come and do some sewing for me.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">[219]</a></span></p>

<p>“All right, mother,” responded the boy.</p>

<p>“Are you going on your machine?” asked his
sister.</p>

<p>“No, sis. I don’t want to run any chance of
puncturing a tire after dark. It’s too near the
race for that. I’m going to walk.”</p>

<p>Off Jerry started. Mrs. Northrup lived in a
cottage about a mile from Mrs. Hopkins. She
was a widow who went out dressmaking. To get
to her house Jerry had to pass the handsome residence
of Mr. Nixon.</p>

<p>He looked at it as he went by on his way to
deliver the message. There seemed to be no one
about, and Jerry wondered if Noddy was at home,
and what he was doing. Mrs. Northrup was in,
and, as she wanted to write a reply to the note
Jerry had brought, he had to wait a few minutes.
Then the widow asked him all about himself and
his family, and inquired about the coming race,
which she had heard Jerry was interested in.</p>

<p>So, though the boy had meant to stay but a
short time, he was there the better part of an hour,
and, when he had the answer to his mother’s note
and was on his way back, it was nine o’clock and
quite dark.</p>

<p>As Jerry came in front of the Nixon residence
he was surprised to see no lights in the house.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">[220]</a></span></p>

<p>“That’s queer,” he said to himself. “The
place is usually well lighted, for they always have
company there. I guess Mr. and Mrs. Nixon
must be away from home.”</p>

<p>He was about to pass on when he noticed a faint
glimmer of light near the automobile shed, Mr.
Nixon having recently purchased a big touring car.</p>

<p>“Rather dangerous to go out there with a lantern,”
Jerry thought, “especially if they have oil
and gasolene stored there. I wonder if Noddy
is there?”</p>

<p>There was a side street, rather narrow and seldom
used, which extended along the Nixon property
to the left. It passed close to the automobile
shed, and a drive-way had been constructed to enable
the machine to be taken out into the side roadway
if desired.</p>

<p>Having nothing particular to hurry him, and
being of a curious turn of mind, Jerry decided that
he would walk down the narrow thoroughfare and
look at the new automobile shed, which he had not
seen at close range. Accordingly he turned from
the main street and soon found himself opposite
the shed. He stopped to look at it, and, as he did
so, he heard voices in conversation. At the same
time the flicker of a light through a crack in the
shed door could be seen.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">[221]</a></span></p>

<p>“I wonder if it’s thieves trying to steal the
machine,” thought Jerry. “Guess I’ll watch a
little while.”</p>

<p>He took a position behind a tree where he could
see what went on without being observed. The
voices in the shed grew louder.</p>

<p>“I tell you I will take it!” some one exclaimed.</p>

<p>“That’s Noddy,” said Jerry softly.</p>

<p>“I know what I’m doing,” Noddy went on,
seemingly in answer to an objection from some one
whose words Jerry could not distinguish. “You
can come along if you want to, or stay behind.”</p>

<p>Jerry shrank closer behind the tree. There was
a glare of light as the shed door was opened, and
in the beams the boy could distinguish the form of
Bill Berry. That he and Noddy were planning
some new escapade was evident.</p>

<p>“Is it all right?” asked Noddy, sticking his
head out of the door.</p>

<p>“Yes.”</p>

<p>“Come on then,” went on the bully. “Put out
the light. We’ve got to escape in the darkness.
It’s a good thing the folks are away to-night.
Well, here is where we leave Cresville behind, and
those three cubs that got me into this trouble!”</p>

<p>Jerry heard the sound of the motor car being
cranked up. Then, as he waited in the darkness,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">[222]</a></span>
he saw the big touring machine glide out of the
shed under Noddy’s guidance.</p>

<p>“Jump in, Bill!” called the youth, and Berry
did as requested.</p>

<p>Noddy threw in the gear clutch, and the machine
rolled slowly down the inclined drive-way to
the street, right opposite Jerry, who still crouched
behind the tree.</p>

<p><a href="#image04">“He’s running away in his father’s automobile!”
Jerry exclaimed softly.</a> “I wonder if I
ought to give an alarm?”</p>

<div class="caption"><a href="#Page_222">“HE’S RUNNING AWAY IN HIS FATHER’S AUTOMOBILE!” JERRY EXCLAIMED,

</div>

<p>The motor car was now turning out into the
main thoroughfare. It bore no lights and made
scarcely any noise.</p>

<p>“No,” thought Jerry. “Let him go. It may
be better that way.”</p>

<p>And so Noddy, afraid to face the consequences
of his confessed crime, fled from his home. Pondering
over what would be the outcome on the
morrow, Jerry went home and to bed, resolving to
get up early and tell his chums what he had seen.</p>

<small>THE GREAT RACE.</small></h2>


<p>“Have you heard the news&mdash;great excitement&mdash;big
robbery&mdash;Mr. Nixon’s automobile stolen&mdash;Noddy
kidnapped&mdash;terrible&mdash;awful&mdash;whoop!”</p>

<p>Andy Rush let out the above avalanche of words
as he met Ned the next morning, as the merchant’s
son was on his way to see Jerry.</p>

<p>“What’s all that, Andy?”</p>

<p>“Last night! Somebody kidnapped the auto
and rode off in Noddy&mdash;fearful&mdash;terrible&mdash;I
mean some one kidnapped Noddy and rode off in
the auto! I’m all excited!”</p>

<p>“I can see that without being told,” remarked
Ned. “But can’t you calm down a bit and explain.”</p>

<p>Andy tried but it was hard work. Ned gathered
that something out of the ordinary had happened.
As soon as he could leave Andy he hurried
to Jerry’s house.</p>

<p>“Have you heard the news?” asked Ned.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">[224]</a></span></p>

<p>“About Noddy and the auto?”</p>

<p>“Yes.”</p>

<p>“I was there when it happened.”</p>

<p>“You don’t mean it! Tell me all about it!”</p>

<p>Thereupon Jerry did. He had no sooner finished
than Bob appeared and wanted the particulars.</p>

<p>“Have you told any one about this?” asked
Ned.</p>

<p>“Only you two.”</p>

<p>“Then we’d better go and tell father. He expects
us to meet Noddy again at ten o’clock to-day.”</p>

<p>The three chums called on Mr. Slade. He was
greatly surprised at what Jerry had to tell, and he
agreed that no especial good would have come
from Jerry having given an alarm at the time.</p>

<p>“I must see Mr. Nixon and explain the situation
to him,” said Mr. Slade. “The sheriff had
better be told also. You boys might as well come
along, to give certain details.”</p>

<p>In a little while the three boys, with Mr. Slade,
were in the drawing room of the Nixon home.
Mr. Nixon, looking worn and pale, greeted them.
Mr. Slade went over the whole story, occasionally
calling on one or the other of the boys as to certain
facts. He told the circumstances from the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">[225]</a></span>
time Ned saw the light in the mill until the happenings
of the previous night, when Jerry saw
Noddy run away in the automobile.</p>

<p>“I am deeply grieved at my son’s conduct,” said
Mr. Nixon. “It is a bitter blow to me. I thank
you Mr. Slade, and you boys also, for being so
considerate as not to publish the story broadcast.
I have shame enough without that.</p>

<p>“I shall pay back the thousand dollars Noddy
took. I will ask you, Mr. Slade to be a witness
to that transaction. As far as the automobile is
concerned, that was my property, and, in order to
save my son from being branded as a double thief,
I here and now make him a present of the machine.
So he is in something that belongs to him. I only
hope he comes back, for I love him in spite of his
faults.</p>

<p>“I agree with you, Mr. Slade, that the sheriff
must be informed. It is only due Ned, to clear
him of all suspicion, though any one who knew
him would be sure he was never guilty. That is
all that can be done, I believe. When I pay Mr.
Judson the money he has lost he will have no reason
for proceeding against my son. This ends the
mill robbery mystery forever I hope. Once again
I thank you all for your consideration.”</p>

<p>Mr. Slade quietly motioned for the boys to withdraw<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">[226]</a></span>
and Mr. Nixon was left alone in his grief
and sorrow. That afternoon Mr. Slade accompanied
Noddy’s father to Mr. Judson and the
stolen money was repaid. The mill owner agreed
to begin no legal proceedings against the misguided
young man. Nor was there any charge against
Bill Berry, though Mr. Nixon said he wished
Noddy was out of the bad man’s influence. When
the sheriff was told of the circumstances and informed
that the case had been settled he announced
that he was satisfied.</p>

<p>“I always did like the looks of you, Ned,” he
remarked, “and I was sorry to arrest you, but
duty is duty, you know, as the elephant said when
he squirted water in the face of the man who stuck
a pin in him.”</p>

<p>The boys did not quite see the connection, but
decided to let it go at that. The sheriff, who had
called on Mr. Slade, at the latter’s request, went
off, and said the case was ended as far as he was
concerned.</p>

<p>“And now to get ready for the race to-morrow!”
cried Jerry. “Everything is straightened
out, and we only have to think of winning.
Hurrah!”</p>

<p>Each one was up bright and early the next morning,
though the races did not start until two o’clock<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">[227]</a></span>
in the afternoon. It was a beautiful September
day, just cool enough to take the temper from a
warm sun, and with only a light breeze blowing.</p>

<p>Somehow the morning passed. The boys made
one trip to the grounds without their machines, and
found men busy raising the banks at the turns of
the course, so that there would be less danger to
the riders. The turns were banked with wood,
although the track itself was a hard dirt one.</p>

<p>Though it seemed hours and hours until the
hands of the clock approached the “two” mark,
they did eventually. Shortly before one o’clock,
however, the boys were at the track. Old Pete
Bumps was there ahead of them, having been sent
over by Mr. Baker.</p>

<p>“Here we all be, happy and free,” said Pete,
as he greeted the boys.</p>

<p>“Here, just stay near the machines,” said Bob.
“And mind, don’t go away from them, no matter
if some one offers you a pipe, cigars, tobacco and
matches.”</p>

<p>“That I will not, I will stay on the spot,” said
Pete, gravely.</p>

<p>“My, what a crowd!” exclaimed Ned.</p>

<p>And indeed there was a big gathering. The
grand stand was almost filled, and the bleachers
completely, while hundreds stood up all the way<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">[228]</a></span>
around the oval track. There were many ladies
and gentlemen, club members and citizens of Cresville,
besides any number of boys and girls.</p>

<p>The Cresville Athletic Club was a well known
one, and the big prizes offered for the motor-cycle
race had attracted riders from all over the state.
There were thirty starters, and, as the track was
not wide enough for them all to line up at once
it had been decided to get them away in three
batches of ten each, the second squad to start off
after the first finished, and the third after the second.</p>

<p>The boys made quick work of getting into their
racing togs. Then, with fifteen minutes to spare
before the five minute warning gun would send all
practicers from the course, they went out on the
track. They found their machines were working
to perfection, and each one, in his secret heart,
hoped he would win the coveted first prize.</p>

<p>It seemed no more than a few minutes before a
gun went off, and a man with a megaphone began
shouting to have the track cleared. People scurried
for their seats, and there was a tense feeling
in the air, that always precedes a test of strength
and endurance. Riders hurried from the course
to give a last drop of oil to their machines. Late
coming contestants were busy pinning their numbers<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">[229]</a></span>
on their shirts, and, altogether there was a
scene of confusion.</p>

<p>Though it was the largest race the three chums
had ever been in, they kept cool. They had all
their arrangements made, and soon, with all the
other riders they were called to the judges’ stand.
They were briefly told of the rules, and then lots
were drawn to determine in what squad the riders
were to start off.</p>

<p>Ned, Bob and Jerry each drew different numbers.
Ned was to start off with the first batch,
Jerry with the second, and Bob with the third.</p>

<p>In this way it would not be known until the very
last squad had finished who had won, and thus interest
would be maintained until the end.</p>

<p>“Bang!” another shot was fired. It indicated
that the races would start in two minutes.</p>

<p>“Go in and win, Ned,” advised Jerry as he and
Bob left their chum with the riders of the first
batch.</p>

<p>“The same to you!” exclaimed Ned.</p>

<p>“Line up!” called the starter, and the ten riders
mounted their machines, which were held for
them by men engaged for the purpose by the club.
There was a moment of suspense!</p>

<p>“Go!” shouted the starter, at the same time
firing his revolver.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">[230]</a></span></p>

<p>The riders, shoved off by those who held the machines,
pedaled furiously, and then, having sufficient
momentum, started the motors. It sounded
as if a battery of gatling guns had gone into action,
for most of the contestants, in an endeavor to
lighten their cycles, had taken off the mufflers, and
the wild cheer that was given by the spectators as
the batch started off was drowned to the contestants
by reason of the gas explosions.</p>

<p>Ned handled his machine well, and secured a
good place, about third from the front. He quickly
had his motor going at full speed, and he was
delighted to see that he was increasing his lead
over the man behind him. He was slowly creeping
up on the man ahead of him, when the latter
looked back. Then he turned on a little more
power, and slowly drew away from Ned. The
boy knew, then, that there was at least one machine
faster than his.</p>

<p>Around and around the track the riders went.
They took the turns at dangerous speed, and one
man had a spill that put him out of the contest.
Another burst a tire and had to withdraw. Ned
managed to pass one of the men in front of him,
but by that time some one had come up from the
rear, and he still found himself third.</p>

<p>Suddenly, as he passed the judges’ stand, he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">[231]</a></span>
heard a revolver shot, and saw a red flag waved.
It indicated that there were two laps more.</p>

<p>On the eight riders swept like the wind, and, a
quarter of a mile from the finish, one of the riders
in front of Ned began to slacken speed. His batteries
had failed at the last moment, and Ned
rushed past him, a good second in the first squad.</p>

<p>“Fine!” exclaimed Jerry as he and Bob rushed
up to congratulate him. “I only hope I do as
well!”</p>

<p>“I want to see you do better,” said Ned.</p>

<p>Little time was lost in getting the second detachment
off. Again the explosions sounded and the
air was rent with cheers. Jerry had secured a
good start, but he had not made more than two
laps before he was aware that a plan to get him
into a pocket was being made. He tried to avoid
it but he was pitted against racers of skill, most of
them grown men.</p>

<p>Once inside the fatal “V” shaped formation
of riders Jerry gave the race up for lost. His machine
was going almost at top speed. He managed
to get directly behind the fourth man in the
left leg of the “V,” and hung there, hoping some
chance might offer. He knew he could make a
good record if he was allowed to escape.</p>

<p>Then, when there was but a mile of the race left,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">[232]</a></span>
there came a chance. The man behind whom he
was riding burst a tire. He fell from his machine
and there would have been a serious smash-up had
not Jerry quickly and skillfully turned aside, shot
through the gap made by the missing fourth rider,
and, swinging away from the pole a bit, taken his
place second from the leader. Jerry threw his
motor on to full speed. The man in the lead had
his there already.</p>

<p>Jerry was hopeful. There was one lap more
and his machine was working like a charm. He
was but ten feet behind the leader, whose cycle
was working to the limit, and Jerry saw that he was
slowly but surely forging ahead.</p>

<p>Then one of those things happened that come
so unexpectedly and so inexplainably to gasolene
motors. Jerry’s suddenly refused to work. The
explosions ceased. He worked the pedals frantically,
but it was of no use. The batch of riders
swept past him, and he saw with regret and chagrin
that he was distanced.</p>

<p>“There goes my chance!” he said sorrowfully
as he dismounted and pushed his machine from the
track. “All our hope is in Bob now!”</p>

<p>No sooner was the second squad of riders out
of the way than the third batch came hurrying
on the track. They were lined up, the pistol<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">[233]</a></span>
cracked, and away they went. Ned and Jerry,
who had found a good place to watch, strained
their eyes for a sight of Bob.</p>

<p>“He’s close to the front!” cried Ned.</p>

<p>“No, he’s away to the rear,” said Jerry, and so
it proved.</p>

<p>By some mischance Bob was third from the rear
as the riders swept around on the first lap.</p>

<p>“He doesn’t look discouraged,” said Jerry.
“Maybe he is running his motor slow, and trying
to keep out of a pocket.”</p>

<p>“I hope so,” grunted Ned.</p>

<p>With the exception of two riders well to the
fore, and Bob and two others in the rear, the
contestants were pretty well bunched. For several
laps no one gained an advantage. One man tried
to steal up, but he was promptly pocketed and lost
whatever chance he had.</p>

<p>“Why doesn’t Bob do something? There are
only two miles more!” groaned Ned.</p>

<p>“Watch him!” cried Jerry suddenly. “I believe
he’s been hanging back on purpose, so as not
to get in a pocket.”</p>

<p>Ned gazed with straining eyes. Certainly Bob
seemed to be increasing his speed. He was sixth
from the last. Another lap was reeled off. Bob
crept up two more places.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">[234]</a></span></p>

<p>“Bang!” went the gun. The red flag was
waved. There were two more laps and the race
would be over.</p>

<p>“He’s got to do something quick now!” exclaimed
Jerry.</p>

<p>“And I’ll bet he’s going to do it!” exclaimed
Ned as Bob swept past, a look of determination
on his face.</p>

<p>Then, while the big crowd looked on, almost
holding its breath, something happened. Bob
turned the levers of his machine with a quick motion.
He shot forward on his machine as an arrow
leaves a bow. Outside and around the bunch
of riders he swept! Past the two confident leaders
he went! Up ahead to the very front he
forged while a mighty shout went up!</p>

<p>“If he can only keep it!” cried Ned, and his
voice had something of agony in it.</p>

<p>And keep it Bob did. He held his place the
rest of that lap and during the next, though he
was close pressed, and swept across the line a winner!</p>

<p>“He wins this heat! I wonder if he wins the
race!” cried Jerry.</p>

<p>Their doubts were set at rest a minute later.
The announcer, with his big megaphone invited
silence with uplifted hand.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">[235]</a></span></p>

<p>“Race won by Robert Baker!” he shouted.
“Second was Timothy Wilson, and third William
Jones. Time of the winner&mdash;”</p>

<p>But the crowd never stopped to hear what the
official time was. With wild shouts, with the tossing
of hats and canes in the air, they cheered again
and again for Bob.</p>

<p>“He’s won the race! He’s won the race!”
cried Ned jumping about and slapping Jerry on
the back. “Now for our touring car!”</p>

<hr class="chap" />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">[236]</a></span></p>




<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XXIX" id="CHAPTER_XXIX">CHAPTER XXIX.</a><br />
<small>A TRIP OVERLAND PROPOSED.</small></h2>


<p>Ned and Jerry had a hard time making their
way through the throng to where Bob stood. The
crowd evinced a desire to catch up the victor and
carry him on their shoulders. That a boy of his
age should have won a race where many veteran
riders contested was no small honor, and the people
of Cresville were proud of Bob. Even the girls
went wild with delight.</p>

<p>“It was just grand!” cried Alice Vines.</p>

<p>“Oh, I felt like jumping up and down when
you won,” came from Mollie Horton.</p>

<p>“I never saw anything more exciting,” put in
Helen Gale.</p>

<p>And all three of the young ladies looked as if
they wanted to hug the winner of the contest.</p>

<p>But Bob had no desire to be made a hero of,
and dodged those who would have done him public
honor. He slipped to one side, and managed
to join his two chums.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">[237]</a></span></p>

<p>“Fine!” cried Jerry. “However did you
do it?”</p>

<p>“I just took it easy until they thought I had
no speed in my machine,” answered Bob, smiling.
“Then, when I saw a chance, I let it out. I’m
sorry you and Ned didn’t win though.”</p>

<p>There were other races to come, bicycle events,
a running contest and a test against time by an automobile,
but the boys wanted to get off by themselves
and talk matters over, so they went to the
dressing rooms, donned their street clothes, and,
Jerry’s machine having been fixed, all three motors
were left in charge of Pete Bumps.</p>

<p>The boys found a quiet corner of the grand
stand and sat down to talk.</p>

<p>“Do you still think you’ll ask for an automobile?”
inquired Ned.</p>

<p>“Sure. That is if father will let me have one,
and I don’t see why he will not.”</p>

<p>“If you get it we’ll have some jolly fun,” spoke
Jerry. “Think of what we could do with it!
Why, we could even make a trip overland!”</p>

<p>“That’s what we’ll do if our folks will let us,”
agreed Bob. “Think of going across the United
States in a touring car!”</p>

<p>The athletic contests were soon over. Mr.
Wakefield spied Bob in the grand stand.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">[238]</a></span></p>

<p>“You’ll have to come out of that,” he cried with
a laugh. “We want you.”</p>

<p>“What for?” asked the boy.</p>

<p>“The winners are to be formally announced in
the club house, and their certificates are to be
awarded. Come along!”</p>

<p>Rather against his will, for he did not like to
be shown off before a crowd, Bob went. His two
chums followed. The main room of the club
house was filled with people who had witnessed
the races. At the sight of Bob they set up a cheer,
and the boy would have escaped had not Mr.
Wakefield gently detained him.</p>

<p>Then came the announcements of the prizes, and
the statement that Bob had come in first, and won
the grand trophy, which was to be anything he
might select at a cost of two thousand dollars.</p>

<p>“And here is a certificate to that effect,” said
Mr. Wakefield, handing him an engraved card.
“When you make up your mind what you want,
let me know and you shall have it.”</p>

<p>“I know about what I want,” said Bob, “but
I’ll have to ask my father first.”</p>

<p>Bob’s father had not had time to go to the races,
it being impossible for him to leave the bank, and
Bob made up his mind to ride down to the institution
and tell the banker the result of the contest.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239">[239]</a></span>
He promised to meet his chums a little later, and
let them know how Mr. Baker regarded the automobile
project.</p>

<p>“Well, are the races over?” inquired the
banker when his son came into the private office.</p>

<p>“Yes, sir.”</p>

<p>“How did you make out? Come in tenth or
last?”</p>

<p>“I won.”</p>

<p>“You don’t mean to tell me you got first prize!
Not the two thousand dollars?”</p>

<p>“That’s what I did, dad,” replied Bob, laughing.</p>

<p>“Shake hands!” exclaimed the banker. “I’m
proud of you, Bob, my boy! What are you going
to take as your prize?”</p>

<p>“I&mdash;that is we&mdash;er&mdash;you see,” burst out
Bob, “Ned, Jerry and I agreed if either of us
won, to ask for a touring automobile.”</p>

<p>“Good land, boy! what do you want of that?”</p>

<p>“We thought we’d take a trip across the country.”</p>

<p>“Well, well! This does beat all!” exclaimed
Mr. Baker. “An automobile! Goodness gracious
sakes alive! What a boy you are!” and Mr.
Baker sighed and laughed by turns.</p>

<p>“Well, what did he say?” asked Ned and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">[240]</a></span>
Jerry, when the stout youth joined them a little
later.</p>

<p>“I think he’ll let me have it,” replied Bob, with
all a boy’s positiveness.</p>

<p>“Then hurrah for the trip overland!” cried
Ned. “Make way for the Motor Boys in their
mad rush across the continent!” How the boys
got their coveted auto, and how they went on a
long trip, wherein they had many adventures, will
be told in the next volume, to be called “The
Motor Boys Overland, Or, A Long Trip for Fun
and Fortune.”</p>

<p>In it Bob, Ned and Jerry will continue their adventures
and, also, will be told how they took part
in a mad race across the mountains to the gold
mines, and how they met their old acquaintance,
Noddy Nixon.</p>

<p>The boys got a taste of the pleasures of riding
in an automobile that afternoon. After Bob’s announcement
of what he thought his father’s decision
would be they strolled about the town. As
they were turning a corner they saw a big touring
car approaching.</p>

<p>“Why, it’s Mr. Wakefield!” exclaimed Jerry.
“I didn’t know he had a machine.”</p>

<p>“I wish he’d ask us to take a ride,” spoke Ned.</p>

<p>The car came nearer, vibrating with the power<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241">[241]</a></span>
of its motor. Then it slowed down, ran close to
the curb and stopped.</p>

<p>“Hello, boys!” exclaimed Mr. Wakefield.
“Want to go for a spin?”</p>

<p>“Do we!” exclaimed Ned. “We were just
wishing you would ask us. But I didn’t know you
had an automobile.”</p>

<p>“I only got it to-day,” explained the athletic
instructor. “I purchased one some time ago, and
have been taking lessons in how to run one in Boston.
They sent my car out to-day but I didn’t
get a chance to try it until now because of the club
races. Come on! Jump in!”</p>

<p>The three boys lost no time in complying. Bob
got in the front seat with Mr. Wakefield, for he
thought if he was to have an auto he had better
learn as much about how to run one as he could.
Jerry and Ned were in the back. Off they started
and made good speed.</p>

<p>“We’ll go out in the country a way,” said Mr.
Wakefield. “I know a nice pleasant road.”</p>

<p>Soon the car swung into a broad highway shaded
by big trees through which the sun, that was beginning
to sink into the west, shone faintly. On
and on they went for several miles. Then as the
evening shadows were beginning to fall, Mr.
Wakefield turned his car toward Cresville, which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">[242]</a></span>
was reached all too soon for the boys, who had
enjoyed their ride greatly.</p>

<p>“Thanks!” they chorused as they alighted.
“It was great!”</p>

<p>“Glad you liked it,” returned Mr. Wakefield.
“I will take you again, some time.”</p>

<p>“If we only had a car like that!” sighed Jerry,
and Bob and Ned echoed his wish.</p>

<hr class="chap" />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243">[243]</a></span></p>




<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XXX" id="CHAPTER_XXX">CHAPTER XXX.</a><br />
<small>AN IMPORTANT LETTER&mdash;CONCLUSION.</small></h2>


<p>It was a week after the race before Mr. Baker
fully made up his mind to let his son have the
automobile. Before announcing his decision he
had a talk with Mr. Slade and with Mrs. Hopkins.</p>

<p>“It isn’t so much letting Bob and his chums
have the auto,” said Mr. Baker, with a smile, “as
it is what they will do after they get it.”</p>

<p>“That’s so,” admitted Mr. Slade. “Still they
are pretty careful boys, and their experience with
the motor cycles has been good training for automobiling
for them.”</p>

<p>When Bob was informed of the decision he
could scarcely keep from jumping up in the air
and giving an Indian war-whoop. He raced off to
tell his chums.</p>

<p>“It’s all right! We get it! Dad just told
me! The automobile&mdash;touring car&mdash;we’ll take
a lot of trips&mdash;start next week&mdash;whoop!” Bob
shouted.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244">[244]</a></span></p>

<p>“You’re as bad as Andy Rush!” exclaimed
Ned.</p>

<p>“I feel like him!” cried Bob.</p>

<p>Little time was lost in notifying Mr. Wakefield
of the boys’ decision.</p>

<p>“I’m glad you took that,” he said. “I know
where I can get a fine, strong, serviceable touring
car for the amount of the prize.”</p>

<p>“And will you order it at once?” asked Bob
eagerly.</p>

<p>“By the next mail,” promised the instructor,
with a laugh.</p>

<p>The three chums strolled down the main street
of Cresville, their happiness showing on their faces.
They passed the post-office, and Jerry happened to
think of a letter his mother had given him to mail.
He stepped inside and, after dropping the envelope
in the slot, looked in the family box to see if there
was any mail. There was one missive, and, when
the clerk had handed it out, Jerry saw that it was
addressed to himself. It was postmarked New
York.</p>

<p>“I wonder who can be writing to me from
there,” he said.</p>

<p>He tore open the envelope and took out a small
folded paper. It bore no date and began abruptly.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_245" id="Page_245">[245]</a></span></p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“<span class="smcap">To Jerry, Ned and Bob</span>: You cubs are responsible
for me being an outcast. You drove
me away from home, and forced me to come here.
I will not forget it, and some day I shall square
accounts. <em>Look out for me!</em> It will not be well
if we meet. <span class="corrsig smcap">Noddy Nixon."</span><br /></p>
</div>

<p>“Well, I like his nerve!” said Jerry, after he
had read the letter over a second time. “As if
we made him take that money. Look here!” he
called to Ned and Bob, showing them the letter.</p>

<p>They were much surprised at the veiled threats
contained in the missive.</p>

<p>“I wonder what he thinks he can do to us?”
asked Ned.</p>

<p>“How does he come to be in New York?”
asked Bob.</p>

<p>“He probably went there in his father’s&mdash;I
mean in his own&mdash;automobile,” said Jerry.
“That isn’t much of a trip for a big car.”</p>

<p>“Well, I guess we will not let the letter worry
us,” went on Bob.</p>

<p>“I wonder if when we happen to be touring the
west we will meet with Noddy?” said Ned, presently.</p>

<p>“And I wonder if he’d really try to do anything
to us,” put in Bob.</p>

<p>“Don’t talk about it,” said Jerry. “We are
comfortable now, don’t worry about the future.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_246" id="Page_246">[246]</a></span></p>

<p>And then the three chums went home, to wait as
patiently as possible for the automobile to arrive.
They did not know what was ahead of them, but,
as Jerry said, what was the use of borrowing trouble?
The future looked rosy indeed.</p>

<p class="cap">This is one of the last stories penned by that
prince of all juvenile writers, Horatio Alger,
Jr., and is one of his best. It describes the
adventures of a youth brought up in the country
by an old hermit. When the hermit dies the boy
obtains work at a nearby hotel, and later on drifts
to the city and obtains a position in another hotel.
There is a mystery concerning the lad’s identity
and likewise the disappearance of a certain blue
box, but in the end all terminates satisfactorily.</p>

</div>

<p class="cap">This story was penned by Mr. Alger some
years before his death, but has never appeared
in book form. Ben was a city newsboy,
rather rough, but with a heart of gold. He
did a great service for a good-hearted farmer, and
the latter took Ben home with him. The lad had
never been in the country before, and his eyes
were opened to a new world. Then the youth was
sent to a boarding school, where he made his way
to the front amid many difficulties. Mr. Alger’s
charm as a juvenile writer is so well known it is
needless to mention it here, and this story is in
his best vein.</p>
